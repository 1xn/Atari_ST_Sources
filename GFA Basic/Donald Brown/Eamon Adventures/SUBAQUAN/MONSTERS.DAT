You see a creature, which strongly resembles a lumpy porcupine, shuffle out of the depths of the cavern. It stands almost 9 feet tall, and bears many long (.3 meter) spines, which it uses in a defensive manner.

From the corridor enters a peculiar creature. Its shape is human, but it's skin is red-hued and its face is but a blank metal slate. It is dressed in drab colored overalls, and walking in a stiff lock-step.

After you travel 3/4ths the length of the passageway, another android appears at the opening leading into the central dome. It wears a white lab smock with the samurai symbol emblazoned on it.

You see the larger of the two creatures. It stands almost 9 feet tall, has rough, grey skin, and a shark-like head with wide, tooth-filled jaws. Extending from either brow is a thick tentacle which flares out almost 1.2 feet.

Standing towards the back of the room is a silver-clad figure who works intently over the corpse of a fish that is stretched across a long table. Upon noticing your entry, it advances, carrying a pencil-sized device.

Another figure, also clad in silver garb, looks over the other's shoulder. When it sees that the other is going to engage you, it spends the turn dipping its hands in a dark oily-looking fluid (stuff that was taken from the dead fish...)

Strapped to the table is some type of water-breathing humanoid, who is unconscious. When you enter, the larger android retreats behind the table, unstreaps this fish-man, and starts working at his 'black box' intently.

You see the first of your companions, 'Cool Jules', who stands before you in full chain, and wields a very wicked-looking axe. He's very large in stature, and smiles grimly at you.

Another man, somewhat thinner but just as mean looking, catches your eye. The Baron Jemmas, as he calls himself, is clad in leather and carries both a shield and an energized mace.

Standing next to the Baron is somewhat less-than-trustworthy person called 'Red-Eye'. He wears normal clothes, claiming that armor 'only bogs him down.' He's armed with a light crossbow.

You also see Archibald, the mutated panther. He wears no armor, and carries no weapons: he doesn't need any. His natural abilities and dark purple coat of fur are all he needs. He can (and usually does) use his hind legs for movement.
