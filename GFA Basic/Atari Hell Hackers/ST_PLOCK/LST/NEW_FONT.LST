change.font

' I have not yet discovered how to use a FONTKIT-font with TEXT. Yes, I
' could load a new font after installing GDOS, but that's not what I'm
' looking for. Is there a quick and not-dirty way to convince GEM that a new
' font has been installed?
' A font-table for the 8x16 font occupies 4096 bytes (16 bytes/character,
' 256 characters). A FONTKIT-font usually has a name attached at the end,
' that's why I reserve 4114 bytes. TOS ignores the name completely, it's
' only used by the accessory FONSEL.ACC. You can load any 4096-byte font in
' the Procedure Change.font, you don't even have to change 4114 into 4096.
