                          GFA Basic Procedures

                           1993 David Ashcroft


These  are  some  procedures  for   use   in   GFA  Basic  which  I  have
accumulated over  the  years,  I   have   some   more  but  they  are for
specialist purposes only (eg disk accessing, printer control).

The procedures which are in   the   file   PROCEDU.LST are a selection of
the most useful of them.    Of   course   many   of you will already have
similar procedures but many will not.

The procedures which are included are as follows;

Centre
Freqchange
Tosversion
Tosdate
Keybeep
Gemversion
Day.date
Coldstart
Warmstart
BootB
Versionkeyboard
Mouseon
Mouseoff
Testonline
Copyfile
Verifyoff
Verifyon
Italic.lprint
italic.lprint.off

Following is a list of how to use the procedures in your own programs.

1)      Centre

        @Centre(text$,numberline)

This command is quite a  useful   command.   Basically it centres a given
text on a specified line.   text$   is   the   text and numberline is the
line (y co-ord) at which the   text   is   to  be centred.  An example of
this function:

        @Centre("ICTARI",5)

Care must be taken  not  to   let   the   length  of  the  text exceed 80
characters or the text will 'spill' onto the next line

2)      Freqchange

        @Freqchange

This command is for use on  colour  monitors (or most new televisons - if
once the procedure has  been   called   on   a  TV,  the picture goes all
messed up then re-set immediately  -   I   cannot be held responsible for
any  damage  caused  by   this   command).    This  command  changes  the
frequency of your monitor/tv from  50Hz  to  60Hz and vice versa.  Simply
type in @Freqchange and the frequency will automatically change.


3)      Tosversion

        @Tosversion

After you call this procedure,  the   tosversion  of the computer will be
returned in the string tosversion$.   If   you  get a totally crap answer
then it is because I have not   been   able   to use a computer with that
tos version but it should be easy enough to add yourself.

4)      Tosdate

        @Tosdate

When you call this procedure,   the   Tosdate   of  your computer will be
returned in the string tosdate$

5)      Keybeep

        @keybeep

All this procedure does once called  is   to   give a 'ping' noise - like
that made if you click outside a dialogue box on the desktop.

6)      Gemversion

        @Gemversion

Returns version of Gem in the  string  Gemversion$.  If a silly answer is
returned then I have not come across your version of GEM.

7)      Day.date

        @Day.date(date$)

This is a favourite procedure of  mine.   To  call this procedure use the
command abouve and  replace   date$   with   the  appropriate  date.  The
procedure will give you a day in   the   week   for any date back to 1742
and for many years in the future.   The   day  of the week is returned in
the string day$.

PLEASE NOTE - THE DATE MUST COME IN THE FORM .   DDMMYYYY

8)      Coldstart

        @Coldstart

This function has the same affect as switching the computers power off at
the mains.  It  will   clear   all   viruses  and   any other reset-proof
programs in memory.  Be careful  when   using   this   -  all data in the
computer is lost!!!

9)      Wamrstart

        @Warmstart

This function has the same  effect  as  re-setting the computer using the
button at the back of the computer.   It  does not clear some viruses and
reset-proof programs

10)     Bootb

        @bootb

To make your  computer  boot  from   drive   B   -  you  should call this
procedure - after the computer is  next   reset,  it will attempt to boot
from drive B.  A  program  to   enable   the   computer  to do this could
simply call @bootb and then @warmstart eg.

@Bootb
@Warmstart

11)     VersionKeyboard

        @versionkeyboard

This procedure will return the type   of   keyboard  you are using in the
string keyboardversion$

12)     Mouseoff

        @mouseoff

This program turns the mouse  off  completely  which thereafter speeds up
the computer considerably. If your  program  needs  speed then always use
@mouseoff

13      Mouseon

        @mouseon

This procedure switches the mouse  back   on   after it has been switched
off with the @mouseoff

14)     Testonline

        @Testonline

This program will warn the user if  the   printer  is not on line when it
should be and then not go away until the printer is switched on line.

15)     copyfile

        @copyfile(source$,dest$)

This is a handy procedure  for   copying  single files.  When calling the
procedure sources$ and dest$ should  be   replace  by the source file and
path and the destination file and path respectively eg.

@Copyfile ("A:\ICTARI.PRG","A:\MISC\ICTARI\ICTARI.PRG")

16)     Verifyoff

        @verifyoff

It is generally accepted that  the   disk   verify does very little apart
from slow disk access speeds down.  This procedure turns this off.

17      Verifyon

        @verifyon

The opposite of the above instruction

18)     Italic.lprint

        @italic.lprint

If you want any Epson  compatible   printer  to start printing in Italics
then use this procedure.

19)     Italic.lprint.off

        @Italic.lprint.off

The opposite of the above intruction

You are free to use these procedures in your programs for free but please
give me a mention somewhere (in the textfile etc)

Most of these were written   by   myself   although  some came from other
sources......
