    The Executable (Binary) Files
    =============================
        Nothing very exciting to say here.   Although I said on these  demo 
    screens I would release the sources,  I`ve changed my mind and  decided 
    not to.   This isn`t for copyright reasons or anything like that,  it`s 
    for the following reasons:

    1) The sphere specifications are "hard-wired" to these sources and they 
       are  not "generic" like the sources which have been released -  i.e. 
       these sources don`t allow specifications to be changed easily,

    2) The sources are not "tidy" or documented.   I decided it was  better 
       write  &  document some new routines from scratch than try  to  tidy 
       these up,

    3) Anyway, these sources don`t use a regular sphere, (see CIRC&SPH.BCC\ 
       SPHÿDEMO\SPHERE1.PRG and select leave points!)

        Although  these  sources  aren`t going to  be  available  {I  don`t 
    think}, I`m releasing the executable versions to show what the compiler 
    can do without page flipping (see CIRC&SPH.BCC\INTRO.TXT) - unlike  the 
    sources  which  have  been  released,  these  screens  don`t  use  page 
    flipping.
