    The Spheres
    ===========
        No I did not draw these two pictures of spheres manually, but yes I 
    did  write  the  pure GFA code which raytraced  them!!   The  GFA  code 
    actually  generates a *VERY* high-color (16777217 color to be  precise) 
    RAW  image,  which  I  reduced to Spectrum  format  using  PChrome  3`s 
    "hatched" method.

        SPHERE_3.SPU  is a 3 bit (512 color) image,  and SPHERE_4.SPU is  a 
    4 bit (4096 color) image.  Both are included as demonstration files for 
    the SPU viewer and converter.


    Coming Soon To ICTARI!
    ======================
        These raytracing sources will be coming soon to an ATARI near you, 
    plus much much more:

        * Raytracing on the ST             * Raytracing on the FALCON
        * Texture mapping on the ST        * Texture mapping on the FALCON
          ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ                    ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

        All of course, coded in pure GFA!  So watch this space!
