 Why GFA Basic??
 ===============
    In  my biased opinion,  GFA Basic is the *ultimate* language for  the 
 Atari ST; it can be used for any purpose including: teaching, utilities, 
 serious applications, games & demos.
    GFA`s  syntax  (discussed this month) is like any  other  Basic,  its 
 structure (discussed this month) is similar to Pascal or  Modula-2,  and 
 its compiler (discussed later) is easily as fast as C`s - but GFA is ten 
 times as simple to use.
    GFA  is  the *only* language you will ever need to  use  after  going 
 through  this tutorial.   If you don`t already have a  copy,  it`s  well 
 worth buying,  and I`d recommend version 3.   I`m not sure how expensive 
 it  is off hand but you won`t just be buying it for  the  tutorial,  you 
 will want to use it again and again.   The language can be obtained from

 Why This Tutorial??
 ===================
    I have been coding in GFA Basic for several years and consider I have 
 sufficient  GFA  skills  to do this tutorial - and I`m  sure  they  will 
 balance out any lack in teaching skills!   I have seen some languages in 
 my time and consider GFA the best language for any  machine,  especially 
 the ST!
    In this four month tutorial,  not only will you learn sufficient  GFA 
 to tackle just about any problem,  and build a comprehensive library  of 
 standard  GFA  routines,  but also create a simple  but  addictive  game 
 (LightMaze) along with an art-editor (simplified graphics-package).
    I  CONSIDER THAT THE ACTUAL TUTORIAL STARTS NEXT MONTH.   THIS  FIRST 
 EDITION  IS SIMPLY AN INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING PLUS  INTRODUCTION  TO 
 GFA  -  MOVING EVERYONE TO THE START LINE READY  FOR  NEXT  MONTH!   THE 
 TUTORIAL IS DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER DONE PROGRAMMING  BEFORE.  
 IF  YOU  HAVE  DONE  PROGRAMMING BEFORE  YOU  WILL  PROBABLY  THINK  I`M 
 PATRONISING BY COVERING SUCH ELEMENTARY STUFF THIS FIRST MONTH.
    If you think I am moving too slowly,  then please bear with me as  we 
 will soon be moving onto more advanced stuff:

    Month One = Basic structure, variables, arrays & procedures
                [inc. Exam mark demo prog.]

    Month Two = Functions, control, GEM, graphics1
                [inc. LightMaze V1  &  Art editor V1 demo progs]

    Month Three = Disk, memory, graphics2 (& DMA+chip  or  accessories)
                  [inc. Lightmaze V2  &  Art editor V2 demo progs]

    Month Four = Animation, GDOS fonts, graphic techniques
                 (& accessories  or  STe DMA + chip music)
                 [inc. Santa anim. sequence  &  Art editor V3 demo progs]

    Months 5+ = Problems & solutions (continued), tips by you (continued)
                                                       ------
    I  cannot 100% guarantee that I will definitely be sticking  to  THIS 
 plan, but it hopefully gives you a feel for the way I intend to move.
    Also, if you have any problems with any particular aspects of GFA you 
 can either mail/post them in advance or wait until after I`ve covered it 
 and then mail/post if the problem still exists.   Also,  if you have any 
 GFA tips of your own then please,  please let either me or Ictari (Nick) 
 know!


 Prerequisites
 =============
    As far as hardware and software goes: an ST, a TV/low res monitor and 
 a copy of GFA.   A mouse and joystick are useful but not  essential.   A 
 printer is also useful;  I recommend that you print these tutorials  out 
 if you have the facilities,  all manuals are text only and also designed 
 to be loaded into First Word Plus if you wish to repaginate them.
    For a few of the more advanced areas a STe may be required,  or GFA 3 
 may  be  required.   But the majority should run on any ST and  will  be 
 pre-tested in both GFA 2 and GFA 3.
    A  compiler (discussed later) may also be required for one or two  of 
 the  more  advanced  areas.   But again this is not  essential  for  the 
 majority of aspects covered.
    As  far as knowledge goes:  as long as you know how to run a  program 
 from  the desktop and know that a disk sub-divides into folders &  files 
 then you know enough to do this tutorial!  It is designed for people who 
 have never done programming before.

    I  do not wish to hold any copyright on any sources I send  WITH  the 
 tutorial - they are yours to do what you like with them and use with  no
