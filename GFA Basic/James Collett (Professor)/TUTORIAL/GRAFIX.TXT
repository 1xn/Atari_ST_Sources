 Explanation
 ===========
    In  the  final  edition of this  tutorial  (GFATUTOR.4),  I  will  be 
 covering animation and advanced gfx techniques.  Due to the large amount 
 of  graphical data needed,  I have decided to split it into four  files, 
 one to be included with each of the four tutorials.
    A  routine will be provided with the final edition to join  the  four 
 files and extract the pictures.   In the meantime,  please do not delete 
 the graphics files and just keep them on one side - all will be revealed 
 in the final tutorial!
    If  you  should  lose any of the files or suspect  any  of  them  are 
 corrupt then please do not panic!   There will be opportunity to  obtain 
 the set of pictures,  direct from me (Professor),  after the release  of 
 the final tutorial.
