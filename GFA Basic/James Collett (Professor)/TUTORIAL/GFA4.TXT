 Interpreting And Compiling
 ==========================
    Source  code is not in a form that the ST`s 68000 processor,  or  any 
 machine`s processor,  can execute (or run).   In order to  process,  the 
 source  code must be converted into 'executable  code',  called  machine 
 code. 
    When you normally Run,  from the editor,  GFA 'Interprets' the source 
 code into machine code for the processor source line by source line, and 
 'gives' it to the processor in 'pieces'.  When you run the first line is 
 interpreted and executed, then the second, then the third and so on.
    The disadvantage of this is the interpreting 'gets in the way of' the 
 run-time and slows the processor down.   The solution to this is convert 
 the  entire source code into 'executable code',  store this and  run  it 
 separately  instead  of doing both conversion and execution in  one  go.  
 This is called 'Compiling' the source code into executable  code,  which 
 can then be run without an interpreter from the GEM Desktop!

    The GFA editor comes with an interpreter built in.   But in order  to 
 convert your sources into stand-alone programs, a GFA compiler has to be 
 obtained separately from GFA Media:

    Note   you  ideally  need  exactly  the  same  version  compiler   as 
 interpreter.   (For  example  I use version 3.5e  interpreter  and  3.5e 
 compiler.)
