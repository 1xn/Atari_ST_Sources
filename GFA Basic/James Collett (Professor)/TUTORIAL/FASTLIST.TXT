 Speed Tutorial, Month One
 =========================
    I faithfully hope you will spend at least 1% of the time and  trouble 
 to  go  through the tutorial,  as I have spent  in  producing  it.   But 
 knowing  what busy lives everyone leads and knowing people like to  dive 
 straight in before getting around to reading the instructions, here is a 
 simple  list of the order I recommend you look at the sources,  most  of 
 which have to be Merged:

        VARIAB_1.LST
        VARIAB_2.LST
        COMMENTS.LST
        BRANCH_1.LST
        BRANCH_2.LST
        BRANCH_3.LST
        TRUTABLE.LST
        FORNXT_1.LST
        FORNXT_2.LST
        FORNXT_3.LST
       (TRUTABLE.LST)
        WHILE.LST
        REPEAT_1.LST
        DOLOOP_1.LST
        DOLOOP_2.GFA or DOLOOP_1.BAS
        FORNXT_4.LST
        REPEAT_2.LST
        ARRAY_1.LST
        PROCED_1.GFA or PROCED_1.BAS
       (FORNXT_2.LST)
        PROCED_2.GFA or PROCED_2.BAS
        PROCED_3.GFA or PROCED_3.BAS
        EXAMMARK.GFA or EXAMMARK.BAS

    Note  I  probably  won`t be including a 'speed  tutorial'  in  future 
 months.
