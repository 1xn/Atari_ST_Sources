                               No Dezign..

    This is .oPUs. at the keyboard typing down some shit as usual...
     This time we are going to look at the new CPU Love demo called

                             FUCK InterPHaZe!

This demo won't feature any brainblastin fx but a few nice screens..(hmm)
I am an x-member of InterPHaze and me and a friend was members in a sub-
division called "CPU Love Section", but we thought that IPHZ was a lame
crew and decided to quit (I joined IPHZ before i formed Collapze).
So when we had quit we got a lame idea, a hate demo... And to prove that
IPHZ was no good for us we decided to code the demo in GFA Basic...
Just to make it look a bit extra lame.
But Collapze won't do any such productions.. It's fun with lame demos
but even a lamer as me thinks that a serious demo is more satisfying.
I hope that you don't mind my bad english...
Well CPU Love has'nt got any future democoding plans exept for the
"Snigel Demo" for the C64 (Basic Demo). As you surely understand we
have not made this demo HD installable. We just don't think that you
would install it anyway. Just look at it and then delete it..
