'  Determines current directory path
'
'  Don't expect your program and resource files to be in a certain
'  directory!  Use this to see where the user has placed your
'  program, then look for your resource files in the same path.
'  Also, don't assume that the user wants to save or load a file
'  from drive A:  I find it very irritating when I run a program
'  from the hard drive, and it immediately looks for something
'  in drive A:  I have nothing in drive A: so I get a "Drive does
'  not respond" error.  AARRGHHH! :(
