'  The pic is imbedded into your code.  pic_add% will now
'  hold the start address of the picture.  (32066 is the

'  the procedure below to view the picture.

'  An example:
deg_view(pic_add%)  !  pic_add% is the start address of the pic stored
'                      in the INLINE statement above.
