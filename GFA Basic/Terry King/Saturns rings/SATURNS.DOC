When  it was mentioned that you would be promoted you had big ideas of being  an 
'expansial hygienist'.  Little did you know that this basically meant blowing up 
asteroids  in  a tiny little craft in a positively lethal situation  !  But  the 
colony  on Saturn has given you the job of dispersing the rouge asteroids  until 
such time as they stop (or unless you die first !).

Your small ship has limited firepower and can only fire a few plasma bolts at  a 
time.  These can break up larger asteroids into smaller pieces which can then be 
completely vapourised.  Fortunately your ship does have unlimited power and  can 
easily  out-manoeuvre  the asteroids.  The same can't be said for  your  shields 
though, you can only sustain three hits !

Controls:

Left/right joystick - rotate left/right
Up joystick - thrust
Fire - fire one plasma bolt
SPACE - give up and exit game

This game was written in GFA Basic using the excellent Sprite Works  development 
kit,  everything  from graphics to sound were designed without the need for  any 
extra  programs.  This game features preshifted  graphics,  parallax  starfield, 
realtime  pixel explosions and is the only non-assembly written game to  feature 
top and bottom border removal (optional).

Selecting  F1 on the main menu toggles the border removal on and off.  When  the 
borders are removed you should see the words 'BORDERS REMOVED' at the bottom  of 
the screen.  Remember that the extra 70 odd lines take time to clear and draw on 
and  so  the game will naturally slow down quicker when lots  of  asteroids  and 
bullets are around, than with a normal sized screen.

Freeware ?

Freeware means that you are free to copy this program like PD, but unlike PD the 
copyright  belongs  to the author and pinching code or graphics  would  be  very 
naughty.
