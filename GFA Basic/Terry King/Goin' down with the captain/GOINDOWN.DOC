While  on a short trip across the channel the ships pipes have started to  leak. 
It  is  your job as simple cabin boy to fetch all of the life  buoys  which  are 
scattered throughout the ship and put them on the hooks on the top deck, but you 
can  only carry two at a time.  Only trouble is many of the pipes  have  started 
leaking and the water level is rising fast.  When you find a leak you can  patch 
it  up  simply by passing over it,  but you can't patch it up before  it  starts 
leaking !

To  make matters worse a number of crabs have got in to the lower decks and  can 
give you rather a nasty nip,  so try to avoid them. If you're lucky you may find 
a crab repellent spray which gives you temporary invincibility.

If  you go below the water level then you'll have to hold your breath  in  which 
case the oxygen level at the top right will start to decrease.  You can  however 
catch bubbles for a gasp of badly needed air.

To reduce the water level you'll need to pump the water out by standing next  to 
a  lever  and waggling the joystick up and down (this can  really  knacker  your 
joystick as well as your wrist).

As  a  little bonus for doing your job you can collect lots  of  valuables  left 
behind by the fleeing passengers. 

This game was primarly intended for kids,  but it turned out a little harder  to 
play  as my eight year old nephew confirmed.  I think ages 10 upwards should  be 
able to play this game (just as long as you haven't got a limp wrist !!).

Hints:

Hold fire button for bigger jumps.  Try and get to the lower decks first.  Drain 
off  all the water before completing the level for a big bonus.  Don't open  the 
first door you come to, you may find yourself stuck ! And don't panic !

Controls:

left/right joystick - move left/right
up/down joystick - move up/down ladders or activate pump
fire - jump
SPACE - Restart level if you get stuck

Freeware ?

Freeware means that you are free to copy this program like PD, but unlike PD the 
copyright  belongs  to the author and pinching code or graphics  would  be  very 
naughty.

Enjoy !
