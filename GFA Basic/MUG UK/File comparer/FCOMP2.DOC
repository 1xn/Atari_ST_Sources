File list for 'File Comparer v2.0' by MUG U.K¿
----------------------------------------------

This folder should contain the following programs.  

        FCOMP2.PRG - The program
        FCOMP2.MUG - The resource file
        FCOMP2.DOC - This file you are now reading !!!


If this folder does not contain ALL of the above then complain to the
above P.D. library, for whom this program has been registered with me.

If the above address displays another P.D. Library to that of the one in
the program file, then send me a letter (enclose proof !!) stating which
firm is distributing a registered program that they haven't payed for !!


Introduction to 'File Comparer v2.0'
------------------------------------

This simple little program was written by MUG U.K¿ in the the first instance
as a simple procedure for examining the differences between two bootsectors
from within my program 'Professional Virus Killer v2.0', which is going
to be commercially released by Floppyshop very soon !!

After getting it to work on the 512 bytes used by a bootsector, I decided
to convert it into a fully-fledged program - and here you have it !!

With this program loaded, you select any two files to compare.  The only
restriction with this program is that the files must be of the same
file-length, and they must both be able to fit in the available memory !!
The two files are compared, byte for byte, for any differences between the
chosen two files.  If any differences are found, the offset from the start
of the file is displayed and then the two bytes from each file is also
displayed.  The display formats can be altered, as well as the option of
sending the differences to the screen or printer.


An example of how to use 'File Comparer v2.0'
---------------------------------------------

Here is an example of this programs' use, which is what I mostly use it for !!
I use this program to compare the saved positions of various RPG games.

Say, for example, you are playing 'Demons Winter' by SSI, and your partys'
provisions are not quite up to the amount to feed your party on the next
rest (in simpler terms - YOU'RE STARVING !!), this is how this program can
be used in conjunction with a GOOD file-editor (I use the ancient Disk Doctor
by Antic !!) to edit your partys' amount of provisions.

Save off the current game to your saved game disk.  Copy the file 'PARTY.DAT'
from the folder 'DEM_DATA' onto a spare disk.  Rename this file as
'PARTY.1' and jot down the current provisions total.  Load up the game
again and loose or gain some food.  Save off the game again & quit the
game again.  Repeat the file-copying procedure mentioned earlier, except this
time rename the file to 'PARTY.2'.  Don't forget to jot down the amount
of provisions that your party has in the second saved game.

I suggest that you copy the file-comparer & your file-editor to the same
disk as your saved games.  Load up 'File Comparer v2.0' by yours truly and
select the two files 'PARTY.1' & 'PARTY.2' as the files to be compared.


'File Comparer v2.0' Options
----------------------------

Once the files are loaded in, you are given the options of showing the
differences between each files to the screen, or dumping them on a printer.

Another option will appear asking if you would like the print format of the 
differences shown as a byte format, or as a disk-doctor format.

The byte-format is a number which counts how many bytes from the start of
the file that a difference is discovered.  Eg.  Start +10 would mean that
at byte number 10 in the files being compared, there are two bytes that
are different.

With the disk-doctor format, the differences are shown as Sectors & Bytes
from the start.  Eg.  Start +1 Sector and 10 Bytes would mean that at
byte number 522 (a sector is equal to 512 bytes), there are two bytes that
are different.  I included this option so that users of Antics' Disk Doctor
can jump straight to the differing bytes by using the 'Goto Sector' option.


The File Comparers' output display
----------------------------------

When you start the comparison (I assume in this instance you are displaying
on a screen), you will see some text on the screen.  The first line should
be a line of text saying which program you are using (as if you didn't
realise !!).  On the next few lines should be a description of the
two files that you have loaded including their file-size.  Next there is
the free memory.

If you have selected the byte option, you should see the following lines:


Start +                  File #1              File #2
xxx bytes:            Dec/Hex/ASCII        Dec/Hex/ASCII
--------------------------------------------------------


OR, if you have selected the disk-doctor option, you will see the following
text on the screen:


Start +                     File #1                File #2
Sec/byte:                Dec/Hex/ASCII          Dec/Hex/ASCII
-------------------------------------------------------------


Below the above text will either appear a list (the length will depend
on the number of differences found - obviously !!) of the offset byte
from the start of the files, and on the same line will appear the different
bytes in the first file & then the second file.  Each figure is displayed
in decimal & the hexadecimal values are placed in brackets afterwards.

If you are using the disk-doctor number then the sector number & the
byte offsets will be displayed - again in decimal first & then hexadecimal
in brackets afterwards !!


Back to the example .....
-------------------------

Now, in the example, we are looking for the offset from the start of the
file where the amount of provisions are stored.  Right, assuming that you
have loaded in the two files into File Comparer v2.0, select the options
for printing to the screeb & using the byte-offset for this particular
example.

The screen will whizz up as it displays all the differing figures.  Now
because I thought that this would be a bit fast, I have included a pause
facility !!  If you hold down the left mouse button while there are
differences being printed on the screen, the display will be slowed down
so that you can read it easier !!

I have also included an abort facility !!  By holding down the right
mouse-button you can abort the current comparison being made.  You are
given the option to do another file-comparison or just quit to the desktop
because you've done what you wanted !!

Remember that you (should of) written down the two values from the saved
party files.  Looking in the first column, you should see the number of
provisions in the first party.  Once you reconise this amount, pause the
listing and look across to the amount in the third column.  If this figure
is the amount of provisions in your second saved game then you have found
the magical number to alter !!  If you haven't found it then carry on
searching !!  All you need to do is to locate this figure with your
disk-doctor (or write your own simple program !!) and alter it to the maximum
of 255 ($FF).  Therefore your party won't starve for a long while !!  I won't
tell you exactly what the offset is because everyone has to learn something
new every day - life would be so dull otherwise !!!

If you require a program to allow you to cheat at Demons Winter, then I suggest
you ask your favourite P.D. Library to get a hold of 'Cheats Always Prosper'
(Volume 1), which contains a full-blown cheat routine for Demons Winter.
Also on the disk are five other cheat routines !!  This disk has been released
by 'Budgie U.K', so only the authorised Public Domain libraries are allowed
to stock this disk !!

         | MUG-WARE¿ - An explanation for Public Domain Libraries |
         +--------------------------------------------------------+

This is a new venture that I am embarking on.  I have decided that too many
Public Domain libraries have got their catalogues full of the oldest
versions of my programs.  What 'MUG-Ware' intends to be is a direct link
to the author of the programs that I write (except for my demos !!).

Because all 'MUG-Ware' programs are Public Domain, you can distribute them
in any way that you would normally do within your Library.  If you
send any Public Domain disks onto BBS Systems, then you can also do this
with any of my programs.  The only difference is that you can only sell
my programs if they are registered through me and only then can you
distribute them as per normal Public Domain.

Each program, when it's ready, will be 'offered' to all the Public Domain
libraries.  Besides each program doing a totally seperate function, the
only difference between each program is that every one of my programs
will carry a different registration logo for the respective Public Domain
Library that has registered with me for the nominal (small !!) fee per
program.

For any Public Domain Libraries that are worried about investing money in
my scheme I will ONLY be releasing my programs on a small-time basis.
I won't be releasing 50 programs per year !!  

The first three programs to be released under 'MUG-Ware' will be:-

1) File Comparer v2.0 - this program
2) TCB Tracker Demo Creator v2.0 - available 3rd December 1990
3) Virus Checker v3.0 - not available yet.

I hope that all the good Public Domain libraries will back me up on the
ideas behind 'MUG-Ware'.

Rememeber that unless you pay for a registered copy of each program, then
you can forget about selling that program from your library.  Honesty
is the best policy.
