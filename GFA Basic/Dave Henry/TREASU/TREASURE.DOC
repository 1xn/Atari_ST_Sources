INTRODUCTION

Lost Treasure is shareware written using GFA basic. If you like and
use this program you can pay your debt in one of two ways:

1. Send $5.00 to Dave Henry, 1720 Wickersham Drive, Anchorage AK,
   99507.

...OR...

2. Design 5 or more challenging levels using the program and upload
   them to GENIE to the Michtron or Atari ST libraries.

This is not a bad deal, you even get the GFA source code!!

THEME

The object of Lost Treasure is to recover treasure from pirates which
has been scattered throughout their dungeons. To do this you must
maneuver your treasure seeker (yellow) while avoiding the pirates 
(blue) and other hazards. Pirates will move the treasure, you must
get it from them. If you are caught by a pirate, you die. To make
matters worse they have set explosive charges which them may move.
These are also deadly to you. In order to combat the pirates you
have several assets. 1. You can out run or out climb them. 2. You
can dig a hole through bricks and trap them. They may climb out but
if the hole fills in they fall through or die and another comes to
replace it. 3. You can block their path by opening or closing trap
doors.

FILES REQUIRED

The program is distributed as TREASURE.ARC. You must use a dearcing
program to expand it into its individual files. The files necessary
to use the program include TREASURE.PRG, TREASURE.DAT, TITLE.DAT,
and 1 or more screen levels such as SCREEN01.LT, SCREEN02.LT, etc.
The high scores file, LTSCORE.DAT will be created on your disk if
it is not present. The disk much not be write protected. The file
you are reading, TREASURE.DOC is also in the ARC file.

TITLE SCREEN

There 6 options available on the title screen, Play, Create, Modify,
Scores, Help, Quit. These may either be accessed using the mouse and
the pull down menu, or you may type the first letter of any from the
keyboard. Completion of any of these will return you back to this
screen.

PLAY

To play you must have a joy stick plugged into port 1 (the non mouse
port.) Before play begins you have the option of selecting the 
starting level. This is normally 1. Levels are numbered consecutively
starting with 01, for example SCREEN01.LT. After selecting the level
from the file selector box the file is loaded. Move the joystick to
start the action. After you have collected all the treasure (some may
be held by the pirates) A green EX will appear showing the exit to
the next level. When you reach it the next level in sequence will
automatically load. Three keys on the keyboard can be used during
play. The spacebar will pause the action. The escape key will return
you to the title screen, also showing the score list. The letter D
will cause you to die if for some reason you become trapped and want
to restart the level.

Moving is accomplished by pushing the joystick the direction you
wish to move. You have no control when falling or sliding on slides.
In order to dig you first must find bricks, then hold down the button
and push the joystick in the direction that you want the hold.
Pirates that chase you may not all behave the same, so watch out!

Any time you come incontact with a pirate or explosive bomb you
will die, losing one life, and causing the level to restart. 

Watchout for hidden chutes which appear as bricks. You will fall
through these (apparently in front of) and may not end up where
you expect.

Small off and on switches are used to control the doors. Doors which
begin as horizontal are normally closed and doors that begin as
vertical are normally open. When the down (off) switchs are moved up
all normally closed doors open and all normally open doors close.
The reverse occurs when the switchs are moved up. If the doors are
already in the correct position nothing occurs. Vertical doors will
randomally open left or right possibly blocking horizontal movement.
The switches are activated when your man or the pirates moves past
them.

Escape upward or downward using ladders. You can also jump or slide
down. When the treasure is collected and the EXit appears you may
have additional ladders or bricks to help (or hinder?) you.

Your score is increased 1 point for each pirate trapped, 10 points
for each treasure, and 100 points for completing a level.

The puzzles included with the program are in general difficult
but they have been tested to insure there is a solution.

CREATE

To make a new level you use the joystick in port one. After selecting
Create, a blank screen appears with a flashing cursor in the upper
right corner. The joystick, spacebar and letter keys A through X are
used to design the screen. Move the joystick to position the cursor
where an object is to be placed. Select the object with a letter key.
Move the joystick to make more or change to object with a key. The
joystick button will cause the cursor to erase screen data. The space
bar will enable the cursor to move over already drawn objects with
out erasing them. Letter keys draw objects as follows:

A. Red brick          B. Brown ladder       C. Red solid block  
D. Horizontal bar     E. Horizontal door    F. Red right slope
G. Red left slope     H. Treasure           I. Off switch   
J. Explosive          K. On switch          L. Vertical right door
M. Vertical left door N. Pirate             O. Treasure seeker
P. Open brick         Q. EXit               R. Green brick
S. Green ladder       T. Green solid        U. Green bar
V. Green right slope  W. Green left slope   X. Green open block

Green objects only appear during play after the last treasure is
obtained. All green objects appear in the other normal colors except
for the EXit.

Some limitation of the program include: 1. You must have one and
no more than one treasure seeker. 2. You may have from zero to
a maximum of five pirates. 3. The maximum numbers of doors (includes
both vertical and horizontal) is twelve. (There is no restriction
on the numbers of switches.) 4. You must allow at least one open
space on the top row to allow for entry of new pirates.

When you are satisified with the screen you have designed press the
escape key. When you do this a file selector box appears. All you
have to do is to type in the name for your file and select OK.  

There are some restrictions for naming files. These restrictions
make it easy and automatic to play a game. The name must consist
of 6 letters, two numbers, and must use the extender .LT. For example
SCREEN01.LT. Then subsequent levels would be numbered 02, 03, etc.
up to the maximum of 99. Or you can choose a different name such
as LOSTTR01.LT, LOSTTR02.LT etc. When playing and the highest number
of a name is completed the game will end.

To test out the level you have completed use PLAY. Then escape to
return to the menu bar.

MODIFY

Modify is used to change a level which has already saved on the
disk. First use the selector box to choose the level to be
modified. Then modify it in the same was as creating a new level.

SCORE

The list of high scores and most recent game score is displayed.
This list is also shown at the completion of a game and you are
given an option to enter your name if a notable score is made.

HELP

Help gives a brief summary of play instructions.

QUIT

Quit exits the program and returns you to the desk top.
