TANK TRACKS
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
Way back in the mists of time,
Mastertronic produced a game for the
48k Spectrum called Tank Trax. This
is an adaptation of that game, but
not a clone.
  Obviously you can work the menu,
and so, choosing 1 from the menu
allows you to play the game.
  The game is meant for 2 players. 
Where each player is in control of a
tank.The aim of the game is to
blow the opposition to pieces.
  Each player takes aturn alternately
and can control firing in the
following three ways: 
  Elevation:  This  is  the angle in
which the muzzle is positioned. This
control is used to fire over 
obstacles such as hills.   
  Velocity : Basically the power
used to fire the shell. Variable
velocities enable different distances
to be covered. 
  Turret   : The angle to which the
turret has been rotated to enable
diagonal firing accross the battle-
field. 
  To induce a sense of competition
the user is asked to specify how 
many battles are to be played. To
allow a "best of..." competition.
  Battlefields are made up from the
following three features: water,
flatland and hills.
