Hi,

It's been over ten years since ForeSight was last updated.  Recently, I have
received a few e-mails asking for the source code.  I was able to dig up
what you will find in this zip file.  The last "build" version of ForeSight
is available as it was distributed (to the best of my memory) and a more
recent version is included in GFA Basic source form.  You'll need an ST/STE
emulator and GFA Basic 3.5 to open and edit the source.  It seemed to work
with "Steem" as I packaged this up just now.

It goes without saying that this very old software was never intended to
be distributed in source form.  Please take it with a grain of salt, so to
speak.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of supporting "configuration files" and the
like that are missing.  You're left to your own devices to reconstitute
those files from what you see in the source files if that's of interest to
you.

Please note that the contact information that is embedded in ForeSight is
way out of date.  If you would like to reach me, use the e-mail address
below.

Enjoy.
