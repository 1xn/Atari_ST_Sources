' Error Demo - Vers 1.0 by John B. Holder ---- GFATIP03.BAS. 1.0
' Notes on using the Compiler with this demo:
' Do not use the imbedded commands Option + xxx
' manually select the options from the Dialog Box.
'
' Select the Errors Text+ on option
' Select the Trapv+ option
' Select the Bombs option
' Select the Query Stop "Ever" option
'
'   This will increase the size of the finished program, but it duplicates
' the FULL error trapping capabilities of the interpreter.
'
'
On Error Gosub Er_trap
Clr What_went_wrong
'
' This would be the main body of the program.
'
'
' Let's induce a File Not Found Error # -33
'        That is if you don't have a file named JUVJVJ.DAT
'                If you do....Name it something else!
'
Open "I",#1,"JUVJVJ.DAT" ! just a garbage name to induce the error
'
'
If What_went_wrong<>0
  Print "See ...  We just recovered from an error trapping routine with the Interpreter"
  Print "or the Compiler as this demo clearly shows."
  Print
  Print "Now that we know we have a disk error we can take appropriate action"
  Print ""
  Print At(15,23);"Press any key to continue...."
  ' Since we've seen what we came to do, let's go home to GEM
  A=Inp(2)
Else
  ' We continue on our merry way with the body of the program.
  '
Endif
End
'
'
' The ever ready error subroutine
Procedure Er_trap
  Close
  What_went_wrong=Err
  Alert 1,"An Error Has Occurred! | The number is = "+Str$(What_went_wrong)+" |",1," OK ",Out%
  '
  ' Have to turn it back on in order to use it again!

  '
  ' O.K. Let's get back to the routine that caused all of the problems.
