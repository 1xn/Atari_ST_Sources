The main problem of GFA programmers is the correct GEM-handling. The
key of screen independent GEM programs are the VDI call 109 and VDI
call 102.

This little demo source code demonstrates the complete window redraw
handling and memory management with VDI 109. This source code is free
your GFA experiments.

Have a lot of fun with these GFA hints !
