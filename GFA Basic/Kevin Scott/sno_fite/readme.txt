Message from Kevin:

Since I am releasing these games along with the 
source code into the public domain I really don't
expect any donations for them but if anyone wants to
drop me an email that would be great. Also I am
curious if anyone still has an original copy of
"Cops and Robbers, Too" since mine is toast. I do
have many copies but not the commerercial
release version.
