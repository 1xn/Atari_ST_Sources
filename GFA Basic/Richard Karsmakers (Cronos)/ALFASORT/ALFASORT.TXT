 Alfasort 1.0 - Alphabetical Sorter for ASCII Text Files

 This  is just a really small thingy I wrote the  other  day.  It 
might not be useful at all for 99.99% of people,  but I needed it 
myself  that day so I reckoned there might be one or  two  people 
out there that might need it some day. And even if you don't, you 
can always use the quicksort algorithm in it. It's not documented 
but it works on any system.
 One warning:  Make sure you don't give the target file the  same 
name  as the source file,  for there is no check for this and  it 
would result in the source file getting lost.

 All it does is,  well,  take each line of an ASCII text file and 
sort  it.  Useful if that text file is a listing of  stuff  where 
each  item  is on one line.  Check in a word  processor  or  text 
editor how long the lines are and supply that as a value for  the 
"lines%" variable in the source file.

 Written in around 10 minutes,  October 31st 1995.  This does not 
imply  that  I am a coding god.  It merely implies  that  it's  a 
really simple program (and I took the quicksort stuff out of  the 
"Hiscore  Terminal Utility" (yes,  one of my shareware  proggies) 
source file).
