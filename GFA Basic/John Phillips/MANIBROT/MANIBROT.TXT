
         MANIBROT  v  1.03
         -----------------

      Mandlebrot generator and 
         animation routines
    
       RUN IN LOW RES ONLY 

    Most of the information needed 
 will be found in the bottom right 
 hand corner of the screen as 
 required.

    A few additional notes on the 
 Palette and File Selector

 File types 
 ----------
 .SCR - screen settings 
        Varies, about 20-50 bytes
 .BL1 - Image of screens in
        Degas block format (IFF)
        17384 bytes
 .MAN - Screen data needed for
        animation routines
        64800 bytes (optional)

 Palette
 -------
 CANCEL - resets the current colour 
          to original value

 RESET -  resets all colours to 
          original value

 The original values are those set 
 at the time the palette routine is 
 entered

 To reset to the values as loaded 
 use LOAD.The current file should 
 be ready to be selected on entry  
 to the selector routine. Only the
 palette data will be extracted.

 LOAD - accepts either .PAL or .BL1

 SAVE - saves the palette as a 32
       byte file with extender .PAL
  
 Right mouse click is an
 alternative exit

 File Selector
 -------------
 Accepts the use of wildcards * and 
 ? in file specs.

 For editing purposes file specs  
 are split into filename and 
 extender, each separately editable.

 In addition to the normal keys the 
 mouse can be used to position the 
 cursor.    Hooray.

 Double click selection is NOT 
 implemented.  Boo.

 The first 4 drives(in alphabetical 
 order) will be given individual 
 selection boxes.

 To  access  Drives/Partitions not 
 shown, click on the drive letter in 
 the  Directory line and type in 
 required drive.

 Format

 Standard format 9 sectors,80 tracks
 720K bytes, 5 sector FATs, 7 sector
