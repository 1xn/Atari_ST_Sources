D_FORMAT by DAVE MOONEY.

D_FORMAT was writen in a rush to allow me to create discs that
were readable by both single and double sided drives.

To use the program place the disc to be formated into Drive B
when instructed and press any key. The disc will then be
formatted and a FOLDER writen to it containing one file.

When using the disc simply save all the files that are to be
read by the single sided users first. Next erase the file in the
PROGRAMS folder (it's ERASE.ME) and save the files for double
sided users.

Do not make any alterations to the 'side one' programs after
erasing the ERASE.ME file as this will change the FAT entries
and may make some of the programs unreadable by single sided
users.

This program has been put into the Public Domain and may be
passed around and used freely. It must not be sold but PD
libraries may charge enough money to cover expenses.

All files in this folder, (D_FORMAT.BAS D_FORMAT.PRG and
D_FORMAT.ASC), must be copied together.
