BOOT by DAVE MONEY

BOOT was writen as simple disc boot sector analyser for an
article in issue one of STEN. It has not been extensively
tested on strange format discs but does seem to work OK on
standard format ones.

Included here are the Basic source code, the compiled program
and this document file. The program has been placed in the
public domain and may be passed around freely, without charge.
All three files should be transfered. PD libraries may ask for
a charge to cover expenses.
