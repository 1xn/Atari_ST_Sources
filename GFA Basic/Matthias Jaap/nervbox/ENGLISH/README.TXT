NervBox Atari is a portation of the Win95 program.

Extract and start it :-) Works best as a autostart application
(e.g. using MagiC, NAES)

A dialog with two buttons appears. Move the mouse arrow to [Yes]
and the selectable button will switch to [No] and vice versa.

Note:
The program can closed with the window closer.
