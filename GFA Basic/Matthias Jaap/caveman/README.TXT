			CAVEMAN TRANSLATOR V1.0

ABOUT:
Caveman was originally a Windows program. The port was done with
kindly permission by Warren Pylypchuk. You can modify the dictionary
to teach Caveman more words. The dictionary is plain ASCII and should
be self-explanatory.

His version is Windows based - please don't ask him any Atari specific
questions.

welcomed.


ATARI:
The Atari port is not on par with the Windows version. I haven't
included an editor yet. That's why the version number of Atari Caveman
is 1.0 and not 2.2.
The program is packed with the executable packer UPX. You don't need any
decompression programs.
The source code (userwork.lst) is included. You still need faceVALUE to 
generate a working program.

WHY?
Because! ;-)
Ok, the program was made for a beta-test of the new faceVALUE (in fact a
lot of my programs were made to beta test fV). After NervBox, the idea
was to port another gag program to the Atari. I found Caveman, it was
easy to re-program and that's it!
Uh, and Caveman supports GEMScript (Appgetlongname, Shutdown).
