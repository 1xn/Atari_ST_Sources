Short description for the English version
-----------------------------------------
- Start a game by clicking on "new..." and enter the two player names

This game is made for two players only. If you know Monopoly you'll
feel quite familiar with Milanopoly. Gameplay is almost the same.
You win the game by ruining the other play. You lose a game if you
have less than -2000 Euro on your account.

You can build houses and increase the rent if you own all streets of
the same colour. Up to four houses can be build.

The currency in this game is the Euro but don't worry - it doesn't 
have great influence on the game play.

A few things from the original game are missing: you can not build
hotels, the street names aren't the same as in Monopoly and only two
players are allowed.
