     This Program was converted from  a  listing in a book entitled Writing
     Adventure Games on the C64. Therefore  I  can claim no originality for
     the ideas, only the coding conversion.

     This is a Text only adventure game.  The first THREE letters of a word
     only are needed. Letters are changed to Uppercase.

     A Verb and a Noun separated by a space, then Return, is required.

     For the Directions one of the letters  N   S   E  W then Return or the
     Cursor keys, is all that is needed.

     You can also save or load your game at any time.

     Have Fun
