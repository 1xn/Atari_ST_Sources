    Documentation for MegaFont (the bit your are -supposed- to read)
    ================================================================

Written By The WIZ! (aka  James  Roskell)  many  moons ago (God! I'm old)
using GFA basic v2.summat  (who cares? It's compiled aint it?)

Introduction (Once upon a time, a man had two rabbits.........)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Someone -may- find a use for this, they may not. Whichever, it has become
redundant in my 'folio' and so you may hack it to death with pleasure, as
long as I get some sort of 'original concept by...' bit.

It was originally designed as a  program  for  designing fonts to be used
with a banner printing program, which never saw the light of day.

The program saves  the  file  out  as  a  standard  ascii  matrix and the
original idea was to  rotate  the  characters  individually by 90 degrees
clockwise to ease life with the  banner program, hence the rather strange
code at the save and load stage,  which doesn't work! (If anyone followed
that, please get in touch....)

The program as it stands is the  'prototype' version, and I didn't get an
awful lot further.  So  any  blatantly  obvious  lack  of  error checking
routines is due to  lack  of  implementation,  and  not lazy programming.
Honest guv.

How to use it (What does that button do?......<BOOM!>)
------------------------------------------------------

Couldn't be easier. Most things are  self  explanatory, but there are one
or two 'flash' bits which you may not find, unless you read on...

After loading the program, you will  see  a  16x16 grid, 4 buttons and in
the top right hand corner a  small  representation of your edit, a couple
of arrows and the ascii character you are editing, in the standard system
font.

Clicking in the grid with  the  left  button  will turn the square black,
with the right button, white. Your results  are shown in the small box at
the top right hand corner of the square.

Clicking on LOAD will bring up  the  standard GEM file_sel dialog, or any
other you may be using  (I  personally  prefer Little Green Selector, but
then I'm only using TOS  1.2).  MegaFont  expects  to find .MFT files and
will complain if you try and load  something else. HOWEVER if you try and
load a file of garbage which  you  have renamed filename. MFT the program
will throw a wobbler and chuck you back to GEM.

This problem is fairly easy to  trap  with  an error routine, but I never
got around to coding it. (This  was the 'prototype' version....) You will
see a little box fill as the file is loaded and copied to the array.

SAVE will do the exact opposite  to  LOAD,  bringing up the GEM file_sel.
MegaFont will change the suffix to .MFT automatically.

CLEAR will clear the current grid  frame,  after making sure that is what
you want to do. It would be possible to implement an UNDO feature on this
by simply copying the grid to a temporary array before wiping it.

QUIT should be fairly obvious to most people. It takes you to GEM after a
severe warning about losing all that hard work.....

Clicking on the two arrows will  take  you  back and forth thru the ASCII
set, the letter you  have  reached  being  shown  between, at the bottom.
Clicking on this character will allow  you to GOTO any specific character
quickly.

Do not be alarmed when you first load  a  font that the grid is blank. It
starts at ASCII 32, which as  you  all  know  is  the space. It should be
fairly easy to make the program start at 65, capital A.

That's about it. If anyone -does-  find  something interesting to do with
it, please let me know.

P.S.
If anyone has a rich  father  who  is  the  managing  director of a large
company or organisation, ask  them  about  buying  a  hot air balloon for
promoting their company. I would be able to help out......!!
