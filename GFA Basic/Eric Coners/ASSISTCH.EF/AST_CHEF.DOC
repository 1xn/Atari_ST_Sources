I. INTRODUTION

After  spending money on a series of computer cookbooks for my fiancee  in 
an attempt to get her interested in computing (hopefully interested enough 
to accept,  or at least overlook,  my need to satisfy a craving which  can 
only be fulfilled by buying something new for the computer each month),  I 
found her using the programs once or twice and then abandoning  them.  The 
reason  seemed  to be that they were not user friendly enough to  make  it 
worthwhile for her, or give her much enjoyment with them. After using them 
myself,  I  had to agree with her.  So,  combining my limited  programming 
skills  with an excellent programming language (GFA BASIC),  I set out  to 
write a program which would do what my 'store bought' ones didn't.

Though  the  program has been tested by myself and my fiancee I  doubt  if 
it's  yet  bug free.  Any bugs or desired changes can be  directed  to  me 
through GEnie mail.  I've included the source code to allow minor  changes 
to be made (i.e.  Printer Codes and minor bugs). I make no claims at being 
a good programmer,  so better programmers please don't be to critical. The 
end  of this doc file will list some improvements I plan on making (if  my 
fiancee  continues  to use the program or enough people  are  interested). 
Also included in the list are improvements I would like to make but  don't 
know  how.  If anyone out there can help me with these things it would  be 
appreciated.


II. FILES

     Included should be the following files;

          1. AST_CHEF.PRG
          2. AST_CHEF.BAS
          3. TITLE_SC.PI2
          4. INDEX.DAT
          5. INGREDS.DAT
          6. DIRECTNS.DAT
          7. AST_CHEF.DOC

III. PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS

     A. INDEX

          The  Index screen lists all the receipe's in the  current  file. 
Recipe's will be listed by;  Recipe #, Recipe name, Food Group, Food Type, 
Dish  type,  Temperature (Hot/Cold) and rating (1 -5 stars).The  following 
describes the actions that can be taken from the Index screen.



        1. EXIT - Returns you to the Main Menu

        2. PRINTOUT - Takes you to the Printout Selection menu. 
     
        3. Scroll - Use Up and Down arrows to scroll through the Index

        4.  Pick Recipe Number - This calculator style entry item will  be 
used throughout the program (refered to as calculator),  simple enter  the 
number desired with the mouse then click on ENTER (to start over CLEAR).

         5.  Jump  - Click on Jump then use the calculator  to  Enter  the 
desired recipe number.  The Index will jump to that recipe. This option is 
included to allow for easy movement through the index as it grows.

          6.  Mark  Recipe - Click on SET MARK and enter a number  on  the 
calculator.  That Recipe will be marked and appear RED in the index. CLEAR 
ONE  MARK then recipe number will unmark a marked recipe.  CLEAR ALL  will 
clear  all  marks.   MARKED recipe's can be viewed  or  printed  separated 
using the SELECT ONLY or PRINT ONLY options.

          7.  Select Recipe - To select a recipe to view enter the  number 
on  ther calculator (make sure Jump or Mark is NOT selected).  Once  Enter 
you will be taken to that recipes ingredient screen.


     B. SORT INDEX

         Selecting  Sort  index  will take you  to  the  SORT/SELECT  ONLY 
screen. You can;
          
          1.  Sort the index by;  Recipe Number,  Recipe Name, Food Group, 
Food Type, Dish Type, Rating.

          2.  Select  Only recipe's with certain criteria to be viewed  on 
the index or recipe screens.  That is;  ONLY a certain;  Food group,  Food 
Type, Dish Type, Rating, or Marked Recipe's.
               Selection screens will appear with choices when using  this 
option.  Simply  Click on the desired choice.  If OTHER is included  as  a 
choice;  Click  on Other then Type in the Choice (An exact match  will  be 
looked for).

     C. ENTER NEW RECIPE

          Be careful when entering a new recipe.   Known  errors 
are trapped and your given opportunities to correct before saving.
But the potential for unknown bugs to pop does exist.

       
     INDEX INFORMATION

          1. Hit return if the assigned recipe number (consecutive) is OK. 
If not Hit escape and enter the desired number (If that number exist's the 
existing recipe will be overwritten)

          2. Enter Recipe name
          3. Click on Food Group (Other - Enter manually)
          4. Click on Food Type    "
          5. Click on Dish Type    "
          6. Click on Temperature
          7. Click on Rating

     You will then be asked to Continue, Redo the index, Or Start Over

     INGREDIENTS

          1. Enter the Amount of People the recipe serves
          2. For each ingredient enter;
               Amount (XX.XXX)
               Unit (ie. Pounds, ounces, Teaspoons, Each)
               Ingredient

             Blanks  (return)  are  allowed  and  can  be  use  to   space 
different  segments  of the recipe.  Once entered (Return) a  given  entry 
cannot  be  changed  without redoing the  whole  ingredient  listing.  (be 
carefull)

          3.  When all ingredients are entered,  enter ESC - RETURN in the 
Amount column to exit.

       You  will then be asked to Continue,Redo Ingredients,or Start over

     DIRECTIONS

     Enter the recipe directions by typing in each line. Once a given line 
is  entered it cannot be corrected without redoing the  whole  directions. 
Blank lines (return) are allowed and can be used for spacing.

     When all ingredients are entered, enter ESC - RETURN on the last line 
(on a blank line).

     You will then be asked to Continue, Redo Directions, or Start Over


     SAVE RECIPE

          You will then be asked if you want the Recipe Saved. 

     
     D. EDITING A RECIPE
     
          Editing a recipe follows the same format as entering a new  one. 
You  will  be  shown  the current recipe and may  edit  that  or  enter  a 
different recipe number to edit.  When editing the old information will be 
shown in light printing.  This is only to remind you of what the  existing 
information  is,  ALL  INFORMATION  MUST BE ENTER AGAIN WHEN  YOU  EDIT  A 
RECIPE.


     E. SELECT A RECIPE

          Works the same as selecting a recipe in the index screen.

     F. VIEWING A RECIPE

          1.  Ingredient  screen  -  Shows serves  amount  and  ingredient 
listing.  You can resize the ingredients to serve more or less.  (you will 
be  asked if all future recipes viewed are to show this resizing  or  only 
the current one )

          2. Directions screen - Shows the recipe directions

          3.  Both  of  these screens allow you to  travel  backwards  and 
forwards  through the recipe file (It will show All,  selected  or  marked 
recipes depending on you previous selection)


     G. PRINTOUTS

          1.  Entire Index - Printouts the index (if a select only  option 
is in effect only those will be printed)

          2. Partial Index - Will ask you to give the recipe number range

          3.  Complete  Recipe Listing - Will printout a  selected  recipe 
including the Heading, Ingredients and Directions.

          4. Ingredients or Directions only - of a selected recipe

          5.  Marked  Recipes  - will printout a complete listing  of  all 
recipe's marked.


IV. ODDS AND ENDS

     A. FILE REQUIREMENTS

          The program, data and screen files must be in the same directory 
and be the exact same names as are listed above.

     B. FILE SIZE LIMITATIONS

          The maximum file size is currently 300 recipe's.  This is  based 
on  a limiting factor of storage space of a double sided  disk  containing 
the required files. Each recipe consumes a total of 2,293 bytes (70-index, 
1023  - ingredients and 1200-directions).  300 recipe's will  use  687,900 
bytes  of disk space and memory.  With the amount of memory  the  programs 
consumes this is also approximated the file size maximum for a 1  megabyte 
memory configuration. 

          If  you have a Hard Drive and more than one megabyte  of  memory 
you can change the file maximum in the program dim statements to allow for 
larger files.

          If  you  have a single sided drive or 1/2 a megabyte  of  memory 
your  maximum  file  size will be about 125 recipe's (this  has  not  been 
tested). 

          There  is  some checking for free memory and disk space  in  the 
program before allowing new recipe's to be entered.  However,  this hasn't 
been tested and I don't know what will happen if you do go over it.  So be 
carefull    as   you  get  near  the  file  maximum  for   your   computer 
configuration.  I would suggest makeing a new file disk before you get  to 
the maximum file size.


     C. MAKING A NEW FILE DISK

          The  program  looks  for the three data files  under  the  names 
listed here in the directory the program was run from.

          If  you  want to start a new file,  copy the program  and  title 
screen  to  a new disk (or rename the current data files  so  the  program 
doesn't see them -dangerous make sure you rename all three data files)  or 
new  directory (Hard Drive).  Run the program.  An alert will tell you  no 
recipe files were found. Click on NO to the change disk request. This will 
take you into the program without a recipe file in memory. Select 'Enter a 
new  recipe' and enter a recipe.  New Index,  Ingredient  and  Direction 
files will be created.


     D. BACKUPS

          Again,  the program has been somewhat tested but all bugs aren't 
known. Specifically what will happen when the file size starts approaching 
maximum.  Back up your data files frequently,  especially before  entering 
new  recipe's,   editing  recipes's,   making  new  data  files  and  when 
approaching file maximum.

     E. DISK ACCESS

          As you files increase in size it will take an increasing  amount 
of time to load them at program startup. I don't know how to speed this up 
right now but will work on it.  Running the program from a Hard Drive does 
help the situation.


V. REVISIONS

     If there is an interest in this program I will continue to revise it. 
Below  is  listed revisions I am now planning ( an * next to  it  means  I 
don't know how to do it yet and would appreciate help if someone does).

    *1. Speed up disk reading of files.

     2. Continue to correct bugs when found.
 
     3.  Set up a subroutine to save Selected or Marked files to new  data 
files.  To make it easier to organize like recipe's into the same file  as 
files get larger.

     4.  Allow  for different recipe files to be selected from within  the 
program.

    *5.  Use a point and click routine when selecting a recipe for viewing 
or marking instead of using the calculator method.

     6.  Make a 'Shopping List' subroutine to add up all ingredients  used 
in marked recipe's.

    *7. Have the ingredient and direction entry work as a text editor.

    *8.   Allow  for  longer  ingredient  and  direction  listings   (with 
scrolling) (and keeping compatability with my current filing system)

    *9. Have some of the screens draw faster with consuming more memory

     10. This doc file.


VI. INCLUDED RECIPE'S

     Included  with the program are some recipe's my fiancee has  entered. 
This  should  give you an idea of the format of the program  and  get  you 
going  more  quickly.  You can keep them or trash them and start  you  own 
files  from  scratch (You may want to try some of them a  few  are  pretty 
good).


VII. CONCLUSION

     Well  that's it.  I think I covered most of the important  points.  A 
quick  endorsement  for  GFA BASIC.  This is the  first  program  of  this 
magnitude I've every tried to write.  GFA BASIC made it alot easier than I 
thought it would be. Some of the subroutines use in the program were taken 
from other public domain programs (like the sorting subroutine).  I  tried 
to  leave author's names in the source code (if they were there  to  start 
with).  I just like to thank every one who has uploaded GFA programs  with 
the  source code included,  it's help me learn quite a few tricks I  never 
would have otherwise.
