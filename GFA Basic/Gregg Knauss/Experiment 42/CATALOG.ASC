EXPER42 is Edwin, the Mutant Snake in Experiment #42! by Gregg Knauss.
In this color only game you a snake (really, a nice one!).  When
presented with a maze to travel, and lots of snacks as incentives, you
move through the maze, hunting for the food, avoiding running into
yourself and more.  You are scored as to how fast you complete the maze
(you can see the whole maze from above) and how much of the fruit you
eat.  Joystick controlled.  This is a GFA Basic 3.x program and requires
GFARO30.PRG (found in the Suzy B's Software UTILITYS catalog) to run.
