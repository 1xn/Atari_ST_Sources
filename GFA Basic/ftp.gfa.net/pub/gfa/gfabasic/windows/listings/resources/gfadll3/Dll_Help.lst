Utilities
---------
Most of the utilities use a file selector of one kind or another; for each,
there are appropriate keyboard controls; TAB, arrow keys, Enter, Alt+F4, PgUp,
PgDn, Home, End,; also, Alt+underlined letters (first letter usually) work.

Copy/Move
- right button anywhere except left box is a quick exit
- left side
  - right button in left box selects/deselects ALL
  - left button - click/hold & sweep makes multiple selections
    - no key    - selects file/path under cursor & deselects old
    + Shift     - selects ALL files/paths between old select & new
    + Control   - selects new file/path without deselecting old
    + Alternate - same as NO KEY
  - to open a directory  double-click on the directory 
  - to go back a directory, double-click on the ".." 
  - to change drives, click on the drive box & then on the drive letter [-C-]
- right side - here you are selecting a path (drive/directory) to put your
  files; simply move to the location you want using the left button & double-
  clicking
- notes - if you wish to MOVE  files, click on the 'MOVE (Delete Source Files)'
        - OK/Alt+O/Enter begins the Copy/Move operation
        - Cancel/Esc/Alt+C/Alt+F4 exit without Copy/Move

Kill
- basically the same as the left-side Copy selector

ReName
- basically the same as the right-side Copy selector but here you are
  selecting one file not a directory (a directory can NOT be renamed using
  this)

Free Space
- no file selector but a drive selector; click on the button & watch the
  status box at the bottom

Directory Change
- much like the left side of the Copy selector except that it gives you more
  info (double click as above); a single click will show you the long or
  Windows'95 filename; the 'OK' button, etc. will change the path$ (the
  directory you are in); 'CANCEL', etc. leaves the original path

Make Folder
- much like 'ReName'

Remove Folder
- use 'Kill' (folder does not have to be empty)

Notes
1) I have developed my own files selectors because none of the one's available
   with GFA will allow you multiple selections
2) while the NAME of a disk or drive shows in these selectos & can be selected
  it is NOT affected by any command given in these utils but could be used in
  special cases such as when you want file attributes
3) don't use DLG 3D ON/OFF as you loose all control over color in dialog boxes
4) colors in Dialog Boxes can only be changed in 16-color mode; neither of the
 following methods work in the compiler (v1.07)

  SYSCOLOR COLOR_GRAYTEXT,RGB(128,128,128),0

          OR

  fgrnd=RGB(0,0,255),bgrnd=RGB(128,128,128)
  brush&=CreateSolidBrush(fgrnd)
  brush2&=CreateSolidBrush(bgrnd)
  CB DLG(31),0 TO -1,dlgcolr()

  PROCEDURE dlgcolr(wnd&,msg&,wParam&,lParam)
    SELECT msg&
    CASE WM_CTLCOLOR
      i = LOWORD(lParam)
      SELECT HIWORD(lParam)
      CASE CTLCOLOR_STATIC
        IF i = DLGITEM(31,1000)
          ~SetBkColor(wParam&,bgrnd)
          ~SetTextColor(wParam&,fgrnd)
          RETVAL brush2&
        ENDIF
      ENDSELECT
    ENDSELECT
  RETURN
