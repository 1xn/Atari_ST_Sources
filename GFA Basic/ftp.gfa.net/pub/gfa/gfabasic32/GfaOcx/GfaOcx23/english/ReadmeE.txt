english\sysdir\GfaWin23.exe

  This Setup package defaults to the system directory
  and cannot install the GfaWin23.Ocx to another place.
  The system directory is the recommended place for the
  GFA-BASIC 32 Library and should be used whereever
  possible.

  Please be aware that writing to the system directory
  requires Administrator privileges while running 
  Windows NT/Windows 2300. 

  For the same reason, sysdir\GfaWin23.exe will not run
  if you are not an Administrator _and_ are running
  Windows NT/Windows 2300.
