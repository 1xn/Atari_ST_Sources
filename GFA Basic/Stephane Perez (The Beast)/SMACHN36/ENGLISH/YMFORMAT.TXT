                           YM FORMAT PARTICULARITIES
                           =========================


     The YM format is a bit particular. Unlike other soundchips, YM files only
contain data to be sent to the sound processor. This format has been created by
Leonard/Oxygene for his Atari soundchip emulator for PC ("ST Sound", and it's
really a great piece of software). This format is special because it contains
raw data recorded in direct-to-disk from the original tunes. It isn't very easy
to explain (moreover in English !), but those who use PaCifiST or ST Sound
surely know what do I mean.

* How Sound Machine plays an YM music ?

  It depends if the music is LZH packed or not (Sound Machine verifies if the
header contains the "-lh" string). If there is this header, you should depack
the music with Two in One, LZH Shell or just LHARCENG.TTP. I know it's not very
easy for ST owners who haven't got a hard disk, but contact me if you've got a
better solution ! If the music isn't LZH packed or if it's Ice/Speed/Atomik
packed, Sound Machine will act like for the others formats.

* Conclusion

  I've received some LZH depacking routines from Leonard/Oxygene and Fr‚d‚ric
Dinh but it's in C and assembler... If you have got a GFA routine, please get in
touch with me !
  I hope all the "fanatics" of YM music such as Dma Sc and Senser will like
those new functionalities !  ;-)
