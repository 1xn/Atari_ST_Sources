                   Alternative Interface for the Atari ST 
                             by David Becker 

While attending the Pacific Coast computer show recently I was intrigued by 
the "sculpted" desktop displayed on the Next computer and to a lesser degree
by Windows 3 and some others. Many of these effects were produced on monitors
capable of grey scale with resolutions exceeding 1024 by 768! I decided to
experiment using GFA3 and a monochrome monitor to see if I could reproduce 
an effect comparable to these GUI's (graphic user interfaces) on the Atari 
ST. As a result I would like to introduce you to the ZeST alternative
interface for all ST's! You can decide for yourself how closely (if at all) 
it resembles this new wave of "carved" GUI's!  

ZeST.PRG includes a paint program, calendar, typewriter and database
in a desktop enviroment. Each program is fully functional, however please
keep in mind that this is a demonstration and not a serious application.
(I won't respond to minor bug reports, be warned, there are probably a few!)

Speaking of serious applications... I have included GFA3 source code in case
someone is interested in using the ZeST graphic interface with their own
program (or perhaps expanding and enhancing the simple procedures included).
Go for it!
  
I hope you get a kick out of my ZeST interface and I hope these simple
programs are of some use to you (let me know). Have fun!
