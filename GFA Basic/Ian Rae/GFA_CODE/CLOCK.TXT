Enclosed: CLOCK.GFA - GFA v3 source code
          CLOCK.LST - ASCII version of above
          CLOCK3.RSC - Resource file, keep in root directory

This is one of the first programs I wrote when I bought GFA v3 last summer,
and was intended as a small go at programming GEM accessories.
There really is nothing more to say as the header at the top of the code
describes how to use it.

There were a few problems with this when run with Neodesk 3 and
Harlekin II, although these have cleared up now I have Tos 2.06.

If any one can find the problem cause ( it doesnt let GEM programs launch
properly and occasionally takes over the desktop windows :-) ) let me know.

I'm now rewriting in Lattice C as a bit of practice programming in that
language.

Oh, and it only works in Hi-res... sort it out yerself for a bit of fun :)
