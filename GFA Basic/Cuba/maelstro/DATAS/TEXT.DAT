MAELSTROM for Falcon 030
Coded by Cuba, Poland, 1996

This demo requires: Falcon 030, some free RAM (4 mb recommended). If u have SVGA monitor, then u dont need to worry. I tested it also on TV monitor, but dont know how it works with: RGB monitors, TV sets and VGA monitors. It works in 256 color mode with 640x480 resolution.

U need to use joystick. If no, then after run press space to quit and back to game with joy. There is no shields :) and no other levels.

Okie... if u want to play, press any key... Hmm which one is this ANY?

Well... some more about it. It wont be finished! Yeah.. u have to take it as it is and comments are not welcome :) Gfx is taken from Macintosh version, where oryginally was no backgroud pictures. Well... there also aint any background picture.. Reason is simple. Riker promised to me that he do some... but... he didnt (Flinny - how about logo for yours STIK page :)))))))) ).

I wont continue coding this game. Sad, isnt it? But there is chance to play with it. If u r able to code it, then i may send all sources, and gfx which is nneded to finish coding. One more. In game there are only used 7 objects:
ship ($30 phases), big stone ($3c), middle stone ($28), little rock ($14), one kind of kaboom fire ($0a), second kaboom fire ($12) and missile ($01).
But there is still many more to include and handle in game, like: trottle fire, damaged ship, shield, super nova, UFO - big one, one more damaged ship, UFO - small one, steel ball, comet, whirpool, steel ball with nails and flying apotheke :)
