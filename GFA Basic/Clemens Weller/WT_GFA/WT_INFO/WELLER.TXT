This program was translated into English by Adam Millard-Ball 
1992. The only limitation is that the help text cannot be read 
from within the program, but this is in German anyhow. The only 
bugs that I have found (eg with the delete function) are also 
present in the German version. The original German distribution
disc is available from the ST Club, Tel. (0602) 410241, disc

FOREWORD
--------
  Weller-TOOLS for GFA-BASIC have been designed as a programming 
environment for GFA-BASIC programs. Many programmers, both
professionals and hobbyists, will be supported especially in
debugging and optimisation of programs. Finally all Atari users
will profit with better programs being available.


1. TOOLS FOR GFA-BASIC
----------------------
  There are already some tools for the many GFA-BASIC programmers 
but they are designed for specific purposes only. It is possible 
to divide them into several groups:

  - Shells integrate the interpreter, compiler and other programs 
    into a convenient environment. Short "turn arounds" are
    possible.
  - Cross-reference-analysers enable efficient debugging and 
    optimisation.
  - Outliners shorten the listing to the code lines of interest.
  - Other tools include editors, converters and source-code
    listers.


2. WELLER-TOOLS FOR GFA_BASIC
-----------------------------
2.1. GENERAL VIEW
-----------------
  Weller-TOOLS for GFA-BASIC represent a tool kit which
integrates the most important tools like the interpreter,
compiler, linker, cross reference analyser, outliner and a
flexible programmable shell with desktop functions.

The main features are the:

Cross-reference-analyzer
------------------------
  - outputs references as line number or procedure
  - automatically finds many typing bugs and slips
  - distinguishes between local and global variables and
    transferred parameters
  - suggests improvements eg if global variables could be
    declared as local

Flexible shell
--------------
  - the "turn around" (interpreter -> compiler  ->  editor  ...) 
    will be drastically shortened, especially with the use of a
    hard disc or RAM disc
  - there are no restrictions on the configuration of the
    flexible menu
  - the text editor (e.g. Tempus) is controlled by command
    strings and will automatically load the files of interest
  - the main desktop functions (delete, rename, copy...) are
    incorporated

Outliner
--------
  - analysis of program structure and debugging of logical errors
  - extended folding for procedures and functions
  - library for key words

Output concept
--------------
  - all output can be directed to screen, printer or file
  - supports high and medium resolution and large screen monitors
  - character size and page format adjustable

Help
----
  - extra help for all menu points (in English)
  - 100 kB help text available using table of contents (not in
    English version, but the text is in German anyhow...)

General characteristics
-----------------------
  - high speed achieved by programming of the program kernel in
    assembler
  - support of program modules through comment lines
  - other utilities include print listing, REM killer, datamake, 
    line numbering and statistics
  - all features are usable for other languages, e.g. Pascal or
    other BASIC-dialects (except the cross-reference)

2.2 INSTALLATION
----------------
  The program can be copied into any directory, but preferably
the GFA-BASIC one. For simple installation it is sufficient to
copy the .PRG-file. It is also possible to copy other files which
are loaded automatically during startup, if available.

These files are:
   WT_GFA.INF  path for MENUX, interpreter, compiler and editor
   WT_GFA.FSL  paths for programs in the flexible shell
   WT_GFA.HLP  help file (not much use in English version)
   WT_GFA.PIC  picture file

  The program includes an EPSON- and IBM-compatible printer 
driver. Other printers can be used with the program patches 
(cf. A3).
  Additionally a "\KEY" directory can be declared, which contains 
the  *.KEY-files (for use with the outliner). The outliner
default path takes this into account.

Note:
It is quite easy to print a decorative diskette label. On your
disc there are three "PRINTME"-files for different printer types,
which can be printed out by double-clicking the file in the
desktop and selecting the 'Print'-option.

2.3. HOW TO USE
---------------
  After starting the program a GEM-window is opened and a menu
bar appears. You can now load a file by selecting 'File' and then 
'Load LST file'. As a result you will see a screen similar to the 
one below (the third line is split into two):

            _____________________________________________________ 
menu bar    WT_GFA  File   Shell  X-Ref  Outliner  Extras   Help    
            -----------------------------------------------------
title       ////////| X-Ref: Weller-TOOLS for GFA-Basic |////////
info        |S   P  12<-->137 96v | E:\WT_GFA\WT_109.LST_
                                     _0104270B 003355Z |0355454B| 

                       File: E:\WT_GFA\WT_109.LST
                       Size: 104270 Byte
               Number lines: 3355

  In the example above a file named WT_109.LST with a size of
104270 Bytes or 3355 lines has been loaded. 355454 bytes of
memory remains. The output devices are screen (S) and printer
(P). The printer's left margin is set to 12 characters; the right
137 characters, and the page length is 96 lines.

  The desktop is simply organised. Besides the menu only one 
window is active. The screen will be restored after using
accessories (if you didn't move accessory windows !). The title
bar displays the current task and any messages.

  The info line displays parameters. On the left are symbols for
output devices; "S" for screen, "P" for printer and "F" for file.
If the connected printer is on line a tick will appear next to
the "P". The bell symbol shows that the scroll is turned off and
screen output pauses when the cursor reaches the bottom line. If
a file is loaded, the filename, its length and number of code
lines can be seen in the middle of the info line. Free memory is
shownon the right; this value is reduced while generating a cross
reference.

  Most text displayed on the screen can be either directed to a
file or printed out. The menu will be explained in the next
chapter.

  Whenever output is being displayed on the screen, you can
suspend the operation by pressing 'Control' and 'S'
simultaneously. Press 'Control' and 'Q' to continue. An operation
can be cancelled by typing the 'Esc'-key.


3. FUNCTION REFERENCE
=====================
3.1. WT_GFA MENU
----------------

          WT_GFA
          Info
          ----               
          MM File Copy       | 
          Kontrollfeld       | example
          Snapshot           | accessories
          Druckeranpassung   | 

Info
----
  If the file WT_GFA.PIC is installed, this picture is shown and 
the current version of the program will be displayed. It is also
possible to show help text.

Accessories
-----------
  The "WT_GFA" menu allows accessory calls. The screen will be 
restored after closing accessories. Don't move the window if the
accessory uses its own.  

3.2. FILE MENU
--------------

          File
          Load LST File     
          Output Devices
            Screen
            Printer
            File
          Screen Parameters
            4 point
            6 point
            13 point
            Scroll
          Printer Parameters
            Margin
            Printer test
          ------------------
          Quit


Load LST File
-------------
  This option loads a file into memory. The file is selected via
a fileselect box which stores the last path. It is possible to
load any text file, because there is no checking of whether it
was saved with the GFA Basic parameter 'DEFLIST 0'. The length of
file that can be loaded depends only on the amount of free
memory, (or 100K in this PD version); it is impossible to only
load a part of a file. The file will be stored in memory even
while other programs are being used. This increases speed, so the
cross reference of a 300K file, for example, only takes a few
(3-5) minutes. The file remains in memory until a new file is
loaded or memory is cleared with "Free memory".

Output Devices
--------------
  The output devices are determined here. A tick indicates the
selected device. "File" and "Printer" cannot be selected at the
same time.

Screen Parameters
-----------------
  In order to improve clarity of presentation it is possible to
change the size of the characters. This is especially useful in
conjunction with the outline function and works with large screen
monitors.

Printer Parameters
------------------
  The following parameters can be altered (defaults in brackets):
left margin (12), right margin (80), paper length in inches (12),
form feed after printing has finished (Yes).
  A printer reset is carried out before and after printing. The
control codes can be adapted for more exotic models (cf A3).
  "Printer Test" executes a simple printer test to check margins
and line spacing.

Quit
----
  "Quit" terminates the program without further ado. This is not 
dangerous as all results can be reproduced.

3.3. SHELL
----------
          MENUX    GFA V3
          ------------------
          Interpreter  V2
          Compiler     V2
          Editor (Tempus)
          ------------------
          -> Flexible Shell

  The shell supports interactive work with other programs,
especially with the GFA-BASIC development system.
  The GFA shell will be configured according to the WT_GFA.INF 
file. The standard file contains:
     
     E:\GFA3\MENUX.PRG        * Here path and file names are 
     E:\GFA2\GFABASIC.PRG     * given
     E:\GFA2\GFA_BCOM.PRG     * sequence: MENUX V3, interpreter 
     D:\WP_ADI\TEMPUS.PRG     * V2, compiler V2, editor (e.g.
                              * Tempus version 1.10 or higher)

  Of course it is possible to change these programs to others.
If the editor is loaded, LST- and  output files will be opened if
they exist.

Flexible shell
--------------
  The flexible shell enables access to up to 100 programs; it is
only necessary to click on the corresponding menu entry. The
shell can be freely arranged by altering the file WT_GFA.FSL. By
loading another FSL file you can change the configuration. In the
flexible shell accessories are also available. Return to the main
shell by selecting "-> Main menu" under "WT_GFA".

Desktop functions
-----------------
          Load FSL File
          ------------------
          User Program
          ------------------
          Delete File
          Rename File
          Copy File
          Create folder
          Free disc space

  The most important desktop functions are available here. 

Memory 
------
  If an external program can not be started due to insufficient
memory, it is possible to release memory with "Free Memory".

3.4. X-REF 
----------
          Generate Cross Reference
          Output Cross Reference
          -Output Parameters-
            by procedure reference
            by line reference
            Float variables
            Integer variables
            String variables
            Boolean variables
            Procedures
            Labels
            Local Variables
            Multiple uses of names

  The main support in developing programs is a cross referencer.
It helps to find typing slips and logical errors. The cross
reference finds all variables, procedures and labels. Variables
are divided into local and global variables and transferred
parameters.
  Bugs such as the name of a variable used only once will be
listed. For global variables occuring in only one procedure the
"LOCAL" declaration will be proposed.

Generate X-REF
--------------
  The program file has to be an ASCII-File saved from the
interpreter with the DEFLIST 0 option.
  During generation of the cross reference the output will be
directed to the active device (screen, printer, file). The output
is an ASCII text without preformatting, ie the line length is not
determined.
  To generate a cross reference is hard analytical work. Weller-
TOOLS works very quickly by using assembler routines. The program
crunches about 100K source code per minute.

Output X-REF
------------
  The results of the analysis will be stored in memory. By 
activating "Output X-REF" they will be displayed. Variations are
possible by selecting various output parameters and output
devices. The procedure reference option is recommended.

3.5. OUTLINER
-------------
          Start
          --Key Words:--
           Add
           Remove
           Load KEY File
           Save KEY File
          -Consider:-
            Comments
            Strings
          -List:-
           Fold procedures
           Procedures
           Modules
           One line functions
           1+ line functions
           Local variables

  The outline functions format and making clear the structure of
programs. They show the hierarchy of procedures, the occurrence
of BASIC keywords and changes of variables. A key list contains
all key words of interest, which can be edited according to the
users wishes e.g.:
 FOR, NEXT, WHILE, WEND, REPEAT, UNTIL, DO, LOOP, EXIT IF

  Normally key words will not be searched for in comments and
strings. If necessary this can be done by activating "Comments"
or "Strings". The folding of procedures is similar to the
corresponding GFA-V3 interpreter function. In addition "deeper"
calls of procedures are shown.
  The menu options "Procedures", "Module",... list only the 
procedures, modules, ...

3.6. EXTRAS
-----------
          Print listing
          Number listing
          Line offset
          Remove comments
          Stats.
          Datamake
          Free memory

  The print listing function supports the use of program modules
and names in a quasi-Hungarian code. Printers with  15 inch width
are supported. The option to 'print to file' (by setting 'File'
as an output device), gives the possibility to use more
professional printers for output of large listings by using the
disc in another system.
  A rough overview of a program can be obtained with the
"Stats." (Statistics) option.
  The "Datamake" option outputs data lines together with the
check sum and reading loop to a file. The data can have two
formats, eight or sixteen numbers per line and can  be  printed 
with or without leading zeros.
  The "Free memory" option releases allocated memory for X-REF
and, if loaded, the  WT_GFA.PIC and WT_GFA.HLP files.

3.7. HELP
---------
           Extra Help

  If switched on "Extra Help" gives on line help for any menu
option.

A2  FILE FORMATS
----------------
WT_GFA.INF
----------
  This file is in ASCII format and can be edited by any text
editor. Comments can be added after a *-sign. The file structure
is distinct; the information has be in the described lines. If 
default the following path is used:

A:\MENUX.PRG
A:\GFABASIC.PRG
A:\BCOM_GFA.PRG
A:\TEMPUS.PRG

WT_GFA.PIC
----------
  WT_GFA.PIC contains the welcome picture in Doodle format (32000
Byte). It can be changed or deleted. The allocated memory can be
released with "Free memory".

WT_GFA.FSL
----------
  WT_GFA.FSL is an ASCII file that contains the menu bar and the
corresponding paths for the flexible shell. The structure can be
seen from the file. It is possible to specify up to 100 programs,
but very long paths reduce this number as the GEM buffer may
overflow.

A3  PRINTER DRIVER PATCH
------------------------
  It is possible to patch the built-in printer driver of the 
WT_GFA.PRG file. Using a disc monitor (e.g. DUST.PRG or
MUTIL.PRG) the place of the ASCII string "printer reset" has to
be found. The following control codes there are:

printer reset  1B40000000
        8 lpi  1B30000000
  draft modus  1B78000000
          USA  1B52000000
 paper length  1B43FF0000
  left margin  1B6CFF0000
 right margin  1B51FF0000
     17.2 cpi  0F00000000
 upper margin  1B72000000
 lower margin  1B4E000000


  The codes have to be adapted according to the control codes of 
your printer (cf. printer manual). The FF code is a placeholder 
for the corresponding parameters.
