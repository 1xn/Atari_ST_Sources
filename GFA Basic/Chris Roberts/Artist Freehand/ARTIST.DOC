1.1 Whats On The Disk...
The Disk Should Contain The Following Files & Folders:-
ARTIST97.PRG             The Main Program
ARTIST.INF               The Set Up File
ARTIST.DOC               This File
QUICKKEY.DOC             Key Board Short Cut File
TOOLICON.B?K             Part 1 of the menu icons..
SPECIALS.B?K             Part 2 of the icons, these can be 
                         changed with your own *.B?K files...
Note:The *.B?K files are duplicated, the *.B1K are the low-res 
icons, the *.B2K are the med-res icons and the *.B3K are the
high-res icons.

The ARTIST.INF file contains all the information for the options 
boxes on the tool set ups, this can be overwritten by saving a 
new ARTIST.INF over the original, or by loading in a *.INF file saved 
under another name.
ANIMATE Folder      Example Animations
PICTURE Folder      Example Pictures
VECTOR Folder       Example Vectors
   FONTS Folder     Example Vector Fonts *.VCF
   PICTURES Folder  Example Vector Pictures *.VCT
NEW_ICON Folder     Example Replacment Icons
BLOCK Folder        Example Cut/Paste Block Files
PALETTE Folder      Example Palletes
INF_CONV Folder     Contains the INF conversion Program

All these example files were created by me within the Artist
Freehand Package. Please note some of the folders may be empty.

1.2 Latest Info...
Release V4.0
Due to other bugs, I have yet to fix any med or hi-res problems.
People who have written to me have not mentioned anything wrong here
but I will check it out in time for V5.0

Release 97
I have now fixed Artist freehand so it is fully usable in both high
and med res modes. I have fixed a few bugs and added the high-res
icon set to the latest release. You can now use the quick-keys whilst
on the workscreen to change tools which is very handy as the screen
doesn't always re-draw to quickly especially without NVDI on a standard
Atari 520 STFM.

1.3 Notes For Users Upgrading...
On the disk you will find a program called, INF_COV.PRG. This 
will load in an old ARTIST.INF file (Pre V4.0) and convert it to work
with version 4.0 of Artist Freehand or higher.


2.0 How To USE...

The Main Menu
This is a pretty simple menu with the tools being contained in two 
boxes down the left hand side of the screen, these are for bitmap 
or vector drawing and are contained in individual groups...Each 
tool either a vector or bitmap tool may have an option box which 
will appear in the top right hand corner, this contains all the 
presets for the selected tool if any.

Tools are either clicked on with the LEFT button or are selected 
with the appropriate QUICK KEY (A Quick Key Guide is on the disk 
called QUICKKEY.DOC )and then the RIGHT button or ESC flips between 
the menu and workscreen, except for vector tools where only ESC is 
used to return you to the menu. This is due to the fact the RIGHT button
is used for inserting a gap between points.

2.1 Locating The Required Tool...
To fit more tools in the same space a few tools have been 
allocated to the same icon. Now Lines, K Lines and also Ray Lines 
are all located under the Line icon, (3rd one along, top row) and 
are selectable via the option box as to which one is used. 

BOX, CIRCLE and TRIANGLE are now also all under one icon, (4th one 
along, top row) and are selectable via the icons in the option 
box which are, Box, Rounded Box, Ellipse and Trinagle. Using the 
Regular button gives you Sqaures when using the box and rounded 
box tools and Circles when using the ellipse tool.

2.2 Using The New Vector Tools...
The Vector tools are a new addition to this version.
When using the tools you will notice they share the same 
options box. This contains the following:-
OBJECT         This is the current object you are editing 0-9
EDIT / PASTE   This allows you to either
               EDIT, This allows you to add new lines or
                     Delete lines or shapes by pressing DEL,
                     use the LEFT mouse button to click a new point.
                     The RIGHT mouse button skips a point to
                     allow unjoined lines, it creates a 
                     seperation. ESC quits back to the menu.
               PASTE This allows you to resize an object and 
                     paste it using the RIGHT button, ESC quits
                     back to the menu without pasting.
CURRENT/ALL    This is whether you want to view all OBJECTS or 
               just the current one when PASTING...

There are limitations of only 299 Points per object in the vector 
tools and also only a maximum of 128 points per freehand solid 
shape in an object. 

A new addation to V4.1 now allows you to not only use DEL to 
remove points but also BACKSPACE. BACKSPACE takes you back to the 
last gap inserted, or last RIGHT mouse button press. This allows 
deleting of individual shapes quicker and easier.

2.3 Using The Vector Text...
This is a new additon to V4.1 and enables text to be added to 
vector objects. Now you can select the vector text tool and go to
the workscreen and click where you want the text to appear. Pressing
ESC quits you from adding text to the current object, back to the
main menu. Once it has been added it becomes part of the object and
behaves so accordingly.

While typing the BACKSPACE key deletes a letter at a time but 
when deleting using BACKSPACE after it has been added to the 
object may not delete the entire letter due to some letters being 
made up of more than one shape. Look out for a *.VCF making
program soon.

Text hight and width is set via the options box, as is the
turning on/off of effects such as underline + bold.

2.4 Quick Keys When Using Tools...

When using the tools use the following keys:-
ESC  This returns you back to the main menu.
C/c  This calls up the Colour Selector.
     COLOUR SELECTOR. This can be moved be dragging it from the 
     title bar, and ESC returns you back to editing as does the 
     RIGHT mouse button.
     ***NEW TO V4.5*** When this is called up you can select a new
     colour in two ways, 1 by clicking on it or 2 by moving the pointer
     outside the selecter box so it becoms a hand and clicking anywhere on
     the picture.
+    Change current colour to next colour on the colour bar.
-    Change current colour to previous colour on the colour bar.
INS  Calls up the Cut/Paste menu.
CLR  Calls an alert box offering the choice of clearing the current screen.
UNDO Undo all previous actions with current tool (On workscreen Only
     not on vectors. Unless pasted to the workscreen.).

When using the Text tool, you can use:-
ALT + To increase the text size
ALT - To decrease the text size.

2.5 Changing The Workscreens.
Clicking on the number to the bottom Right edge of the screen 
near the upturned page will call up the workscreen options box,
and from here you can copy and swap the workscreens and also 
change the current workscreen. The current workscreen's number is
displayed as the number in the bottom right.
NEW in V4.1 you can select a workscreen using the number keys across
the top of the keyboard. This can be anything from 0-9 (Menmory
Permitting).

3.0 The Animation Studio.
Old users will be familiar with the animation studio as it has 
changed little since V2.0 (It was not in V1.0, which was released
as Brush Strokes in the P.D.) This will soon be undergoing some major
changes and may be incorperated into a seperate package to enable
more space for drawing and more for animations. This is unlikely
to happen before V5.0

3.1 How to use (Anitmation Studio).
The animation studio is pretty simple to use and involves the
following.
1/ Cutting out upto 18 Blocks
2/ Pasting the blocks onto individual frames.
3/ Selecting a play mode, and sit back and watch.

There are a couple of buttons to use the last x and last y co-
ordinates. These enable the pasting of blocks to frames in the
same positions and also the cutting of blocks to be the same 
size. You can use upto 99 Frames memory permitting.

7.0 Customizing Artist Freehand...
There are quite a lot of options in Artist Freehand Proffesional 
and so obviously differnt configuations will easily be aquired by 
differnt people. Once all your options are set up you can save 
these as an INF file which will set up Artist Freehand the way 
you set it up, Artist Freehand loads in ARTIST.INF as the default 
settings. See 1.4 On how to use old *.INF files.

7.1 Icons
As you may have noticed if upgrading from an ealier version, 
Artist Freehand Profeesional is now Icon orientated. Some people 
said that icons were to fiddly to understand and text on the 
buttons was a better idea, but now due to the amount of tools and 
lack of space on the screen I have gone over to icons. Don't 
dispair all you Icon fearing people, you can replace these icons 
with your own Icons or even text buttons. All you need to do is 
load in one of the default *.BLK files from the disk and replace 
it with your own. Remeber to keep the file name the same size.

When replacing the icons make sure you cut the block out exactly 
around the edges of the icons or when you save it and come to use 
Artist Freehand again the icons will not line up correctly with 
where you have to click, but don't worry you'll soon get the hang 
of it and there are a few replacement sets of icons in the 
NEW_ICONS folder.
NOTE: Due to disk space these are no longer supplied :(
IMPORTANT always keep a back up of the origonal 
icons in case you damage the files when editing so you can always 
put the origonal icons back.

If you want your icons to appear in all resolutions you need to
create a file for each res, B1K, B2K & B3K. To do this paste your
icons onto the workscreen and then save it as a degas or neo
file. Now load it into pic_switch V0.7 or somthing simular and convert
it to the required resolutions. Now load up Artist freehand in
the new resolution and load in the now converted pic and re-cut
the icons and save under the appropiate filename for that res.

8.0 Whats New In Artist Freehand Professional V4.0
        This part of the document is missing
Now see LATEST INFO AT THE START...


8.1 Whats New In Artist V4.1

I have now added a couple of vector FX tools, these are.
EXTRUDE   Which pulls the object out of the screen adding a sort 
          of 3D effect. The level at the bottom effects how far
          back this goes, the higher the closer to the screen it is.
BEND      This curves the vector as though it is wrapped around a 
          can.
X-SKEW    This creates a simular effect to ITALIC text, it slants 
          the VCT object either to the right or to the left.

            WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING

When using the vector objects - BEND and X-SKEW. Make sure all of
the object is on screen and that either the curve or the skew 
doesn't leave the screen. This will corrupt your vct file, and it 
cannot be Un-Done. In the next version it will not be possible to 
use these tools past the screen limits preventing this bug.

            WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING

The CLEAR button on the vector tools has been replaced with a 
far superior Vector ops button, which still allows clearing of 
the object but also allows copying and swapping of objects.

There are also some minor bug fixes in the vector tools,
When Re-Sizing both the X and Y you don't have to wait for it to 
do the Y then the X it does both simultainously making it much 
quicker. Also when deleting previously the colour changed to the 
colour of what was just deleted and sometime went to the 
background colour only to return as the correct colour when 
edditing the tool again. This BUG is now fixed.

You may have noticed on big vector files (Ones with a lot of 
points) when deleting a number of points the slow re-draw every 
time. Now if you want to delete X number of points, just press 
the delete key the required number of times. You will notice a 
re-draw as the first is deleted and then a re-draw only after all 
of the remaining points have been deleted. This makes deleting a 
little easier and quicker.

When clicking on a point in PASTE mode of the vector tools, it 
would re-draw the whold image even if the point haddent changed 
position when the mouse button was released. This BUG is also 
fixed in this version.

The CUT/PASTE tool now re-draws the main menu much quicker after 
use and the non-tool highlighting BUG is now fixed. Also another 
BUG that is now fixed is the highlighting of the current tool 
after either CLEAR SCREEN, CUT/PASTE or SCREEN OP's are called.

9.0 In Vesion 5 or Sooner...
In the next version look out for the following,
     Vector Line Sizes & Vector Line Styles...
     More Vector Special Effects...
          Such as Rotate,
          Perspective
          Concave/Convex 
As well as the following new features.
X Perspective & Y Perspective
Re-Sizing
Map to freehand object
X Skew & Y Skew

Also block drawing tools such as ,
Line, Box, Ellipse, Spray and Draw

Look out for the following in tool quickkeys:-
C is to be replaced with T for a fast tool bar, allowing the 
changing of colour, setting of fill patterns and turning on/off 
of Solid, Rainbow and Shadow.

I am also adding keys to change text style when on the work 
screen to work along with ALT + and ALT -.

10.0  KNOWN BUGS IN V4.0

There are a couple of known bugs in V4.5 these are,
1/ File error if incorrect VCT file is loaded, I am working on a fix 
for this now!     

2/ Rainbow, Mirror and Shadow Buttons not working. This will be
implimented very quickly.

3/ Regular Button incorrectly working on shape options, when using frame.

4/ Globes not drawing properly in some circumstances

This version has a pretty good error trap and if an error does 
occur then you will see a status screen and it will tell you all 
the current information and you will then be asked if you wish to 
SAVE your work, QUIT the program or attempt to RESUME the 
program, although it usually best to save and re-load. Please 
note down any bugs and how they came about and drop me a line and 
A bug fixed version will be made availble if possible.

11.0  Authors Comments
I am hoping to add more vector tools and eventually, have a 
vector tool equivalent for every bitmap tool. I prefer using the 
vector tools, but I will not remove the Bitmap tools, or at least 
in the near future. Please let me know what you think ?

If there are any features you have thought of that this package 
doesn't yet have then please let me know and I'll do my best to 
implement them, in the next release.

P.S I know it has been a while since the last update but i haven't
had use of an Atari for a while, i'm now carrying on development
using an emulator for the P.C which makes life a lot easier,
although the key repeat is disabled and i can't get the \ symbol..
