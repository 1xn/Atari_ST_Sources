Two file-types exist in the LEARNBAS folder:

.BA    -    Power BASIC demo version
.BAS   -    Power BASIC full version


Boot up your Power BASIC select LOAD from the FILE menu, insert Cover 
Disk 5, click on the icon in the top left of the File-Select box
and then double click on one of the BA/BAS files when they appear. 
That's it. The files will load; you may then run them or alter them. 

The following files complement the LEARN BASIC article in the magazine. 


TELEPHONE.BAS

This program demonstrates the use of arrays to store and retrieve
information. You can enter up to ten names and addresses and recall
the phone numbers in any order by searching for the corresponding
name. It also shows use of the INSTR function to search for a given
string of characters anywhere within another string.

The arrays are set up with BASIC's DIM statement and then
each cell within the array can be addressed by quoting its co-
ordinates.


PHONEDAT.BAS

This program is an extension of the TELEPHON.BAS program which stores
and retrieves names and telephone numbers typed in from the keyboard.
PHONEDAT.BAS loads the information into the array from DATA statements
at the end of the file. This means that you no longer have to enter
the information each time you run the program, but can let the program
do it automatically. You can, of course, change the names and numbers
within the DATA statement to make them more relevant to you, and
extend the program by enlarging the dimensions of the array and
increasing the number of items in the DATA line. Make sure that the
number of elements in one dimension of the array is at least as large
as the number of names in the DATA statements, and that if the data
item includes spaces, it is enclosed in inverted commas (").

A single, two dimensional array is used to hold the
information, as this makes it easier to tie the name to its
corresponding telephone number.
