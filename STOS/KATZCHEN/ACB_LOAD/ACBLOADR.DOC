                          STOS ACB SELECTOR
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        As a challenge to myself I  decided to attempt a program which
may be of use to those  like  Paul  Roughly,  who wanted to be able to
automatically load a selection of ACB files into STOS on boot up.

        It is not elegant, but it is structured (by the CHAOS method).

        If you are dubious about  its  use,  then   try it on a floppy
based BACKUP of STOS. I would reccomend that procedure anyway.

        Compile the program AFTER setting  up  the two paths needed to
locate your STOS\EDITOR.ENV file,(mine  STOS  is  deeply nested inside
several folders, hence this method of locating it!)
        Once compiled, you MUST place  the  program BEFORE STOS.PRG in
the auto folder. Then reset and use it!
        The program works as follows...

1)      The program locates  and  loads  the  current  EDITOR.ENV file
within your STOS folder.

2)      Then the ACB files  outside  the  STOS  folder are located and
displayed on the screen.

3)      Use the left mouse button to  select  the  ACB's  you  wish to
install, and press the  right   mouse   button   when  you  have  made
your selections-remember up to 12 may be selected.

4)      Press SPACE to exit with no action taken by the program.

5)      If you do press the right button  and you have made at least 1
and no more than  12  selections,  the  file  names  are inserted into
EDITOR.ENV and that file is resaved.  (No backup is made).

6)      The run is then complete.

        The mouse flickers a lot, and  you  have  to be quick with the
left clicks, but it does work ok.


               DISCLAIMER:      USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

OH!  And due to the lateness of the time, I have not error trapped ANY
part of the program-do it yourself!
