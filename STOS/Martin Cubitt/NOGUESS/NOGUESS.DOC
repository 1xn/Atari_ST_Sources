                Written in STOS BASIC by K.Ingram and M.Cubitt

    Although the idea behind this game is  very simple - computer thinks of
    a number and you have three guesses  at  it  -  we feel that the way in
    which it is presented makes it very addictive.

    The game contains samples, speech, a  high score table and three levels
    of difficulty.

    Each time you guess the number the  computer tells you if your guess is
    too low or too high. You have three guesses and then the computer tells
    you what the answer was.

    The program was written as  an  exercise  for  Keane in taking a simple
    idea and adding to it to get a good effect.

     We hope you enjoy it!
