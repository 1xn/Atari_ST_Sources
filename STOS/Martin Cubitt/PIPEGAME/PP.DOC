 Pipe Perfect :- You may have 1 or 2 players using the joystick ports 0
and 1.

 The story (briefly): You are a mine worker searching for diamonds.
You use pipes to build tunnels to get at these lovely gems.
You are allocated an area of land where you may dig. You may not
venture out of these bounds (or you crash into the imaginary walls!).
There are progressively increasing number of diamonds to get as the
levels fly by. Simple, eh? Well I forgot to mention a few things which
may be of some importance in determining if you stay alive! There 'aint
just diamonds and soil down there. Boy, no! If you have another digger
helping you out you best avoid the pipes he has laid or you may have dug
your last hole. Amongst the various bits and pieces buried with the
diamonds you will find the following...








* Skulls (not very nice so you ought to avoid them),
* Magic Boxes (Sometimes give you points - sometimes take them!), 
* Hard-to-see Brick Walls (don't look too closely!),
* Frogs (Turn to princes and give a another life or loadsa points), 
* Ghosts (Boo! They steal your life),
* Eggs (Great fun - pick an egg and your collegue freezes! No collegue =
        points!),
* Gold (Contains more points than a Hedgehog!),
* Jester (swaps collegue's joystick movements around.
          No collegue = swaps YOUR joystick!),
* Snails (Slow the game down!),
* Oil (Speeds the game up) and
* Thieves (Turns you into a thief - you get collegue's points. No 
           collegue = NO points!)

 You should be aware that your pipe gets progressively faster and faster
as you complete the levels. There are bonus rounds where you do not
really die and the diamonds are worth a lot of points. However, you move
very fast! There are 9 levels but once you reach the ninth you stay there
and you get faster and faster.



 TIPS:
       * Control of the pipe can take a bit of getting used to - stick
         at it!
       * When you have two players try to work as a team, planning your
         movements BEFORE you make them!
       * You have to pull the joystick down to start your pipe going.
       * There is a cheat available!
       * If using the half megabyte version on an Atari 520ST you should
         ensure that the program is in an AUTO folder otherwise you will
         not have enough memory.
       * WARNING: If your score is near 999999 I advise you to die
         otherwise your score wraps round to 000000!
       * You may not have more than 9 lives (you little pussy cat you!)
       * Listen out for the samples. If you hear a wicked laugh your
         collegue has probably just run over a Jester.
       * Do not drink too much beer - this makes things a tiddly bit
         difficult.

 Use Esc to exit current game and 
     SPACE to pause/unpause.

       Good luck and don't forget - "Winning IS everything!"
