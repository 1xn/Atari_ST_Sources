                      ÿÿÿÿÿÿ

  Written in STOS BASIC by Martin Cubitt

 The program PUZZLE.BAS selects one of the
previously selected (using MAKEPUZZ.BAS)
compacted pictures. The picture is cut up
into pieces and you can use the mouse to
rearrange the picture to what you think it
should look like.
 Press Esc if you give up. Use the left
button to move a piece and the right one
when you think it is correct.

 Program MAKEPUZZ.BAS allows you to create
your own puzzles. Firstly you will need to
compact your pictures to STOS MBK pictures.
They should be named 1.MBK, 2.MBK etc.
Then follow the on-screen instructions.
