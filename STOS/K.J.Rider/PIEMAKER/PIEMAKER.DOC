                              STOS PIECHART MAKER
                              ===================

     This little program was written for  my daughters school food project.
     The idea  was to  make  a  coloured  Pie  Chart  of various foods that
     could  be saved  as a Neochrome  picture,   which could be loaded into
     the  Flexidump program, to be printed out in colour.

     The Pie Chart can be either a normal round chart, or an elliptical one
     to give a semi 3-D effect.

     A maximum of six items can  be  used  in  the chart.  (If you want any
     more, then you will just have to add a few lines of program yourself).
     The list of  items,  and  the  chart  can be positioned where you want
     it  on  the screen. If you  make  it  too large, the program will stop
     with an error! It could do with  a  few  lines of program,  so that if
     the chart is too large, it tells you before it tries to run it.  Also,
     if the names of the items are  too  long,  they will run onto the next
     line on the screen. Here again, things could be improved.

     The colour palette is set  for  the  six  different colours of the six
     items. It  would be nice to  be  able  to choose the exact colour that
     you want  to display on the screen, so this part could be improved.

     When  it saves the screen as  a  Neochrome picture,  it can only  save
     one screen,  which will erase  any  other  previous screens saved onto
     the disc. It  would  be useful to be  able to choose the file name  of
     the  screen, before you save it to disc.

     I don't claim that it is bug free, and my programming is pretty sloppy
     in places.  So, here it is for people to play around with, improve it,
     or do their own version.
