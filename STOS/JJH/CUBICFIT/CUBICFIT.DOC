                               -----------------

The cubic fit routine is a routine which when given four points will put a best
fit curve through all the points. An  example  of its practical use can be seen
in many of the new art packages.

This routine is a  conversion  of  a  pascal  procedure  from  one  of the many
graphics book available, unfortunately  I  don't  know  how  it works, just the
parameters required to use it.


Routine interface
-----------------

To use the routine place your four key points into the array PNTS, then set the
number of points, and gosub the routine.
     eg.
          key points are :-
               (start)   1st point 100,150
                         2nd point 200,50
                         3rd point 15,195
               (end)     4th point 319,199


          the code for the above would look like this :-

               200 PNTS(1,0)=100 : PNTS(1,1)=150
               210 PNTS(2,0)=200 : PNTS(2,1)=50
               220 PNTS(3,0)=15  : PNTS(3,1)=195
               230 PNTS(4,0)=319 : PNTS(4,1)=199

          set NUM, number of points to be calculated and then call the routine.

               240 NUM=75: GOSUB 10000


Program breakdown
-----------------

110       set up screen
120       set space for work area and four points

150       input four points
160-180   get mouse input
190       wait for mouse button to be released, this stops all the points being
          entered as the same point. ( remove line 190 for an example ).
200       store the x and y position in the array.
210       if this is the first point then
               plot the point
          otherwise
               draw a line to the current position.
          ( the initial plot is to  stop  the  line  being draw from 0,0 to the
            start position )

230       set colour, and call the cubicfit routine, using 50 points.

10000     cubic fit routine
10030 - 10170  Calculate best fit curve
10150          plot first point or draw a line
