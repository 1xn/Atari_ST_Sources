	At long last the new updated version of SPECSHOW is here.. Not that
much different from the original version, but it does take a little less
processor time when installed. The routine now takes approx 80% of the CPU,
which leaves a little time for other things such as music etc..

	The installation method is the same as v1.0, but for all of you
who didn't see it.. Here it is:-



Using the routine
-----------------


Switching on:-


	screen copy source,physic	; Copy picture to screen

        areg(0)=source : call bnk	; Install palette VBL


Switching off:-


	loke $4d2,0			; Erase palette VBL



Explained
---------

        source : the address in memory where the picture file is held
                 eg.  start(10)
                 
        
        When switching the routine off, all you are actually doing is
clearing the VBL pointer in memory that tells the CPU the address of
the routine. 



Demo
----

	There is a demo basic file, and a picture file to use with the
routine, "SPECSHOW.BAS" & "SPECSHOW.SPU" if any of these files are missing
and you would like them, send me a disk I will send you them as soon as
possible.


It Works You Know
-----------------

	Yes it does work, adding Spectrum 512 images to your programs can
make a lot of difference. Take a look at the NovaDisk 6, reviewed in 
ST Format (June 1995),page 40. NovaDisk uses a text and picture display
routine written by Storm Developments (That's us isn't it?). What display
program do you think it uses for Spectrum 512 images? You guessed it,
Specshow II. And now NovaDisk recieved an "ST Format Seal of Approval"
and a rating of 92%
