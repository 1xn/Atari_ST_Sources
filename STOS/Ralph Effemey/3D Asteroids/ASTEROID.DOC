      3D ASTEROIDS is similar to the classic ASTEROIDS but-
            yes, you guessed it!-it's in glorious 3D.

    The object of the game is to clear the spaceways in your
  sector of space junk and asteroids. You have the latest space
               craft fitted with defence shields.
    Unfortunately, a few space pirates are trying to stop you
   in your dangerous task as space junk and certain asteroids
    are very profitable if taken to Earth and traded for more
                   interesting commodities!!!

   However, the Space Corp does not approve of this scavenging
  and your Rules of Engagement permit you to destroy any craft
  firing on you (or looks as though it is about to fire on you!)

   To play, simply shoot as many asteroids as possible without
      getting hit. You will lose shields if you are hit by
    an asteroid and if you are hit when your shields are down
               you will die and the game is over.


 You can collect extra shields by COLLECTING (not shooting) the
      SHIELD PODS and you can collect extra photon torpedos
                 by COLLECTING the PHOTON PODS.

      You will run out of photon torpedos so this function
                       is quite useful!!!

  Complete one level and you go onto the next where everything
  moves just that bit quicker. Shoot the Pirate ship for extra
        points and the GOLD asteroids for extra shields.

      'R' switches on your RADAR but due to the extra work
  the ST has to do this slows the game down quite considerably
    but I've left the function in in case someone would like
             to use this routine in their own games.

      You can re-start a game from the PAUSE mode by using
    the FIRE button, moving the JOYSTICK or pressing any key
 
                            GOOD LUCK
