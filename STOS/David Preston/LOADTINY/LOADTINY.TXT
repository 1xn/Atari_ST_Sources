
              LOADTINY.BAS routine by David Preston

Graphics files are fascinating things, especially compressed 
(squashed/stuffed/compacted/etc) ones.

After an enormous amount of experimentation and umpteen terminal 
crashes, here's a STOS routine for loading any resolution of TINY 
(*.TNY/*.TN1/*.TN2/*.TN3), unpacking it and displaying it on a 
colour monitor.

I've REMmed it thoroughly, so the listing more or less speaks for 
itself. It works on all the Tinies I've tried, and you may find 
one of each resolution with the Basic program file (disk space 
permitting etc.), which were prepared using David Mumper's 
TinyStuff2 program, which, after all, ought to be definitive. 

David Baggett's Atari Picture File Formats text file explains 
the file format and was my only reference while coding. All REM 
statements can be removed without affecting program operation 
(so long as you do it carefully!) as no REM-only lines are 
referenced in gosubs or (spit) gotos.

Eventually I may crack the opposite process...
