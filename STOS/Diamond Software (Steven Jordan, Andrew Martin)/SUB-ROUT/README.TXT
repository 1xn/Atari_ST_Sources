          By Steven Jordan - Copyright (c) Diamond Software 1993-94


    I have decided to give away some of my old sub-routines from a program
    that I wrote last year - TIDS V2.4.

    You may use these source codes for  you  own program, but you must put
    my name in the credit list!

    I have more sub-routines from TIDS  Version  2.4 which inlude new file
    selectors, fast text viewer (with-out gfx (that's version 2.6!)), data
    and text file loaders, shell source and a few other routines.
