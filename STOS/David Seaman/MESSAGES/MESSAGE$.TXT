MESSAGE$
--------


        I know it's maybe a bit of a cryptic name, but that's what the
routine is called, so there.  What  MESSAGE$  actually does is takes a
variable and turns it into a  string.   The  clever part is that it at
the same time turns a number  of  PENCE  into Pounds and Pence.  ie it
turns 1045 (as a variable) into œ 10.45  (as a string).  This is a lot
harder to do than it sounds, and the finished routine now is about  as
much like the original routine  as  the  Falcon  is like the ZX81 (for
those among you that are a bit slow on the uptake, that is NOT A LOT).

        This routine was actually created  for STock Controller v.1.5,
which will hopefully be released soon (see HELPME!.TXT for details..),
and took approximately, um, a  long  time  to perfect.  Anyhow, if you
can actually work out how it works (and I'm not altogether sure that I
know really), then I hope it  you  find  it useful.  Even if you can't
for the life of you work out how  it works, then you can still use it,
so don't worry if string handling leaves you cold.

        The ASCII routine uses lines  55000-55040,  so  if you want to
use it in your programs then you  will need to either keep these lines
free or change the line numbers in the routine.  I don't know for sure
if it is usable on other BASIC's, but you can always try.
