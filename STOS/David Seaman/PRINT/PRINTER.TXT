     These simple routines (PRINT_SU  and  SU_PRINT)  are an example of how
     to use some of the printer  commands in Martin Cubitts excellent EXTRA
     Extension.  (Get it!)  Well, only two in fact, but never mind.

     They just show you how  to  read  the current printer setting, and how
     to set it.    It   really   is   a   piece   of   cake  with the Extra
     extension.  I don't really need  to   say  any more, because the files
     are really very self-explanatory.
