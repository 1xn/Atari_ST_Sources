
     STC version 1.5.

     This is the FULL  source  code  to STock Controller v.1.5, and it near
     as damit works perfectly.  I think  the  sort routine  is the problem,
     but I haven't  been   able   to  work  out  what!   I  have a horrible
     feeling  it's  something  horribly obvious,  but  still...  If you can
     find  what  it  is  and   send  me  the  fixed  code, I'd be eternally
     grateful!

     As well as  being  eternally  grateful,   you'd  also get a mention on
     the documentation, title   screen,  versions  info  (the fixed version
     will be version 1.6),  and of  course  the credits. Not only that, but
     if  you  want  one  or more  of  your releases advertised I'll do that
     too, and this program is going all  over the world.  (I have places to
     send it in the UK,  Spain,  USA...)  Also,  I'll  give you  some  free
     PD/shareware  if  you like, or Pagestream  fonts, some nice piccys  or
     MOD files (well, I have to  admit  the   MOD's   are  a  bit  naff  as
     I'm  not  much of a composer...)

     Due to the problem I've had   with  STOS  not  getting on with my hard
     drive,  the  program  saves  all  files  to  the root directory of the
     drive you boot from.   This is a bit of a pain but it was the only way
     I could get it to work so there.

     Please please please send me  back  a fixed version if you can fix it,
     you know you want to!

     Waiting in expectation,

     PS. To anyone, please feel free  to  use  any routines in STC that you
     find useful  (some  have  been  in  ICTARI already, but hopefully some
     of the other routines  may  be  of use to you as well).
