     This is a very short  doc,   mainly   because the program is very much
     self  explanatory.    Simply   select   the   function,   select   the
     file/directory as required, and there  you  go, it's done! There, that
     wasn't so bad now was  it?  By  the  way,  this  prog  uses  the EXTRA
     extension by Martin Cubitt for the  disk  COPY and FORMAT commands, so
     if you haven't got it, then get it!
