Menu1
-----


        This is simply  an  example  of  a  menu  shell  using the VAL
command to determine which line of the  program to jump to.  This type
of programming is helpful if you find yourself typing endless lines of
IF....THEN statements to handle  your  menu's.   All  you need is some
thought beforehand as to where  in  your  code different routines will
go.


Menu2
-----


        The principles and advantages of  this program are exactly the
same as MENU1.BAS except it  uses  the  ASC  value  of the key pressed
instead of VAL.  This lets you use  the whole keyboard for your menu's
instead of just the numbers.

        Please note that these program  are  simple demo's of the menu
techniques I often  use,  and  there  is  a  great  deal  of  room for
expansion in both methods.
