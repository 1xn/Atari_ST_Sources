Putkey.
-------


        Did anyone know that  there  is  an  undocumented limit on the
number of characters you can  put  into  the keyboard buffer using the
PUTKEY command?  No, I thought not.  Not that it's a command that gets
used much anyway, but you never know...

        If anyone does want to know  (and  if  you don't, what are you
doing reading this anyway?), the  limit  is  62 characters.  Quite why
this is I don't really know, but it is.

        The "PUTKEY.BAS" simply puts 62 spaces (using SPACE$) into the
keyboard buffer.  It then prints  a  message  telling  you that it has
worked.  Then it puts 63 spaces into the keyboard buffer, which causes
an "Illegal function call" error.  And that's it, really!
