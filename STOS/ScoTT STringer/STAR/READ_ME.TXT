     Here are a couple of starfield screens.  The first ORing.BAS shows off
     a little machine code program I  wrote  to merge two screens together.
     It just uses the STAR  extension  to  create  two versions of the same
     starfield on different screens.  Then  I  use  my machine code program
     (cunningly loaded  into  a  memory  bank)  to  merge  the  two screens
     together using the logical operator OR.

     The second program is another  starfield,  this  time  you can move it
     around with the joystick.  Again  the  STAR extension should be loaded
     with your STOS Basic interpreter.
