Run SWING.PRG, with all the other files in the same folder to see the demo.
Use the mouse and both buttons to control, and ESC to quit.

You can control the puck and the ball, and smash up baddies with it.
The baddies follow split flight paths, although in the game they'll
follow a mixture of single and split paths.

You can't be killed, and the baddies don't fire back yet.  Also, there are
no sound effects.



There are two STOS Basic supporting programs included:

FTAB_GEN.BAS generates the data for the file SWING_FT.DAT in a memory bank,
displaying the repelling map on screen as it does.

PATH_GEN.BAS generates path data.  Don't try to replace the file
SWING_PA.DAT, as you'll change its size and it won't work.  However,
you can alter the data in the basic program to design new paths and run
them.


You can also look at the three .NEO files to see how the sprites and
scenery are stored.



See the source code SWING.S for more details...
