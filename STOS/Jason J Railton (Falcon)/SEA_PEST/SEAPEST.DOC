                              **********

  A simple game by Jason J Railton, written in STOS especially for the
ICTARI Programmer's User Group.  The compiled program SEAPEST.PRG is
freeware - please distribute it.  Don't bother about keeping this .DOC
with it, or the source code (SEAPEST.BAS).  The source code is exclusive
to ICTARI and is not to be distributed elsewhere.

For TOS 2.06 or later, use the latest version of STOSFIX on your copy
of SEAPEST.PRG, otherwise it won't work.

Rules:

1. Click with the left mouse button on a square to reveal what is under a
cover.  If it reveals open sea, you are safe.  If it reveals a mine, the
game ends.  If there are mines in any of the eight squares surrounding
the one you have selected, a number of marker buoys will be revealed.
The number of buoys (1 to 8) indicates the number of mines in those eight
surrounding squares.  Use this information to avoid the mines, and
uncover all the other squares.

2. Click with the right mouse button to put marker flags on squares
suspected of having mines underneath.  Another right click leaves a
question mark on the square, and another removes the marker.  Right clicks
will never uncover squares.  As each flag is placed, the mine counter at
the bottom of the screen decreases.  This does not necessarily mean though
that the flags are in the right place...

3. If you have marked the appropriate number of covered squares surrounding
a square which shows one or more buoys, click with the left mouse button on
that square to uncover any of the remaining squares. 

4. A timer is provided, but there is no actual time limit.



  Novice STOS programmers may like to examine the source code, and add
a title screen, or end-game and next-level sequences to it.  Please send
in your modified versions (source and executable code) to ICTARI, to put
on future disks.

  If you're writing a game in STOS, remember that fast action games are
very difficult.  Either use a fixed background with small sprites, or come
up with a game design that can afford to run slowly.  Remember that the
compiler cannot speed up graphics functions, only maths and IF..THEN
statements.

  SEA PEST was written in a few evenings, but I've been working on a
TETRIS/COLUMNS type puzzle game for months and that's about ready too.
Look out for 'BUZZSAW' on a future issue of ICTARI.  It will be a freeware
release.
