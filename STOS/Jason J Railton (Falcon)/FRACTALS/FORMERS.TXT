A demo of different fractals, drawn using the random technique normally
used on the Sierpinski Triangle.  With the Siepinski Triangle you move 
half-way to one of three corner points.  With others (the square Carpet,
or the Koch Snowflake), you move 1/3 of the way to the points.  With the
Koch curve, you move 1/sqr(2) and rotate by 45 degrees about the point.
I think my Koch Curve Plus uses 1/sqr(4) and a 22.5 degrees rotation, but
I can't remember because I wrote it ages ago.

In freeform mode, use the mouse to plot points.  Plot three or less points
and you get the 1/2 scaled step.  Plot four or more, and the step is 1/3.

Try plotting six points for a snowflake, or eight points in a square (the
four corners and a point half-way along each side) for the square Carpet.
