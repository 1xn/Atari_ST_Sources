Hi folks!                     Dresden, 13th August 2017

Here's the full sourcecode for the Thunderdome demo for Atari ST.
Most sourcefiles are Turboassembler format, but you need Turboassembler to assemble anyway.
Some stuff has been removed/stripped(f.e. the VQ-Audio and VQ-Video encoder and the vectorizer).

I'm very sorry for what all happened from my side in 2016.. 
unfortunately you can't unwind all that crap.

Best regards,
