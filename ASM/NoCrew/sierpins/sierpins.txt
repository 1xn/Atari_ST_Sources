It's a fractal!
It's a tunnel!
It's a speedbump!
No! It's the Power morphing Sierpinski's triangle!!

Run this demo in 320x4[80]0xTC mode on a Falcon.
This demo does not need an FPU, contrary to all my
previous 128 byte demos.

I hadn't seen Reservoir Gods' 128 byte Pasta demo when
I made this, so I haven't copied from them. Besides,
this is better than their simple triangle anyway. ;)

The demo exists after some time, for security reasons.
You will probably get bored before that happens, so it's
ok if you want to press reset. But, make sure you do a 
coldboot, otherwise your computer will behave very weird. 
Sorry about this. Also make a coldboot after the demo has
ended by itself, even if things seemingly might look normal.
