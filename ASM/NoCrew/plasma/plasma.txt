128 bytes Plasma demo by NoBrain
--------------------------------

This is my second 128 byte demo, hopefully more will come.
Run this demo in 320x2[40]0xTC mode on a Falcon with FPU.
The demo works in some other resolutions too, and gives
a different perspective of it. :)

Stare on it long enough, and a beautifully shaped woman
will appear! Really!
