PONG 128
--------

This is not a demo, it is a brand new game from some
ancient parts of NoCrew.

You've played many versions of this game, but perhaps 
never one as small as this. In less than 128 bytes,
you will get a "two" player game of Pong with exceptional
graphics and astonishing sound effects. Yep, you read it
correctly, sound! So, plug in your stereo to the Falcon
and play yourself completely mad! We have!

Run the game in 320x2[40]0xTC mode on a Falcon. It does 
not need an FPU.

You control the paddles using the mouse, the left paddle
is controlled by moving the mouse along the x-axis, and
the right paddle is controlled by moving it along the
y-axis. This makes it possible to use this game as a 
single player game, against yourself, or as a two player
game, if you either fight over the mouse, or make the
necessary hardware modifications.

Don't worry if the paddle would disappear out of screen.
Just move it up again, and all will be fine.
