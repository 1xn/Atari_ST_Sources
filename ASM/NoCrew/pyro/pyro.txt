128 bytes Pyro demo by NoBrain
--------------------------------

You've seen it on New Year's Eve. You've seen it in
screen savers in all forms and kinds. Now there's
a new version out, smaller than ever, of the famous
Pyro effect! 
It could do with some colours, but I didn't have
enough space for that, unfortunately.

Run this demo in 320x2[40]0xTC mode on a Falcon with FPU.

To exit, make sure you do a coldboot, otherwise your
computer will behave very weird. Sorry about this.
