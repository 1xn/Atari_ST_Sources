It was the first demo you saw on the Falcon, now it's back
in a slightly smaller version! The amazing mandelbrot zoomer
with sparkling wonderful colours and in a speed of light. 

All this in just 128 bytes.

Set your Falcon to 320x2[40]0 mode, truecolour, run mandel.prg
and enjoy the ride. But enjoy it fast, cause it's not very long.
Didn't have space for a fancy, controlled flight :)

This demo needs an FPU.
