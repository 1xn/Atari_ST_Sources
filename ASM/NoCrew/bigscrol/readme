One hundred and twenty eight byte BIG scroller.

There are two versions, one for four bitplane mode and another
for mono. Both _should_ work on regular STs, but I have only 
tried them on Falcon. 

For four bitplane version, set the resolution to three hundred 
and twenty times two hundred (and fourty) pixel mode. 
For mono version, set six hundred and fourty times four hundred
(and eighty) pixel mode.

Bot version will with absolute certainty crash the computer upon
regular reset. A long, hard, cold reboot will cure the machine.

Have fun.
