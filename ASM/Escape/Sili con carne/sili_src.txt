Here is the complete sourcecode of Sili Con Carne, the first
Escape demo. This demo made the 3rd place in the demo-competition
of the great Siliconvention'97 party in Bremen.

    SILICON.SRC    The whole sourcecode, containing all effects.
                   IMHO the code is good structures, so anyone,
                   who know how to code assembler should have
                   no problems to read it.

    GFX/           In this folder there are different datafiles,
                   which contain graphic data.
       *.XGA       16-bit Falcon raw picture format. (supported
                   by Escape Paint).
       *.PI?       Degas images, which are used mainly for the
                   intro and the credits-screen.
                   ESCAPE.PI1 is the Escape title picture. I
                   used a pencil to draw it and scanned the
                   paper. CALAMUS.PI3 is a snapshot of the
                   famous DTP-program, which I used to make
                   all intro-texts.
       *.4BP       Special datafiles made using an own Pascal
                   program. This files contain the texts, which
                   are faded in and out at the beginning of the
                   demo ("....presents...an Easteregg prod...").
                   All texts are on the same pictures. Only the
                   palette changes.
                   
   MUSIC/          There you will find the MOD-file from 505/Check-
                   point, which is played in the background and
                   the DSP-replay routine by Bitmaster/TCE.
                   
   SCP/            This folder contains Screens Pain sequences,
                   which are used for setting the resolutions.
                   
   TABLES/         Precalculated data for different Effects....
                   distortion tables, sin-cosine tables, palettes,
                   waveforms for nice moves, multiplication tables...
