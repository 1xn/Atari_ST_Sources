INCUB8ION V1.1                                 Kaiserslautern, 2004-02-29
==============


Ok, finally... with a small delay of almost 3 years.... I finished this
small Whip!-plugin!! I never had the motivation to fix that small bug,
that made this plugin crash very badly. But today we had a very cold and
sunny sunday and I had nothing else to do. So i digged out this piece of
code and fixed the bug.
This plugin made the 2nd (and last :) place on the EIL #2. Most routines
were ripped, since my assembler-skills were not the best at that moment.
So don't expect a master-piece of code.


Have fun!
