The core song player in DeskTracker is based on Replay STe, a NoiseTracker
player written by Wizzcat in May 1991. Work on the GEM interface 
began in April '92 when I got my Mega/STE... a working version of it
was completed in three weeks!

DeskTracker was written in GFABASIC 3.5 and provided a dialog box interface,
but it did look quite like the version you see here. After a year of work
I've added a lot and refined a lot. Don't be deceived by its relatively
small size - I'd call it finely chizelled artwork!

This version is written in Lattice C 5.52. I really do recommend Lattice 
to anyone who is serious about Atari software production in the future... 
if Atari Corp use it I'd say that's a pretty good guarantee of
its longevity.
