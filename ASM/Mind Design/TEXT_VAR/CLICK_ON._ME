How To Use This (I'm Not Saying You Want To!!!)
-----------------------------------------------

This source is an assembler include, ie it's not a runnable program.
If you want to test it, insert it (or use include command) in your
default template (if you have one!).
Prepare the registers as described in the source file.

JSR or BSR to "print_text_varifont".

Why am I even explaining this???? If you got SOME assembler knowledge
then you already got it running...


Killing some bytes
------------------

Did you hear (or read) that MIND Design was dead?
Let's just say that we resurrected...
I've been on a nice long vacation (read: studied), at Musicians Institute
in Hollywood, CA. 
I studied music (that's why it's callled MUSICIANS Institute), and my
instrument is guitar...

Anyway, I guess MIND Design is back (anyone noticed that we where gone??).
Deez, however, is with Wildfire now, but we are currently working on some
stuff together.
And I while I'm on it, I might as well kill the rumours about the
Wolf 3D-type game that we were working on.  I read something about that
in a diskmag. We are NOT finishing that game!

But, as I write this, we are experimenting with some raycasting, but I'm not
sure if it's gonna be like a demo-effect or perhaps a game...

Deez is working on Worms o3o (a worms-clone for the falcon), and perhaps I'm
ending up doing some stuff for that one too (like music, graphics, ideas).
He is gonna release it under Wildfire's name.

Ok, a guess I killed a few ones there (and planted a couple of new ones!)

Anyway, don't you have anything better to do than reading this text?
