
SND minireplay sources v1.4

May 15, 2000



1. Info

   There was some people wanting the SNDH parser and IRQ settings of
   SND Player v1.x, and as we changed the SNDH header with the SND-
   Player v1.1 release, it's not more than right that we do so.
   
   The source is not perfectly "tidy" or simple to read, but we have
   better things todo than spending several days with that. Anyone
   serious enough about using the routines will probably get along
   just fine with the current shape of the sources.
   
   The sources are built up around a simple .ttp shell, we thought
   this to be a little better than having to assemble for each
   song you want to test with it. The code for ttp, loading etc are
   easy to remove though, the source is splitted in several files.

   The sources are compatible with Devpac 3 (possible earlier
   versions as well) and easily changed to suit TurboAsm or other
   assemblers. 
   
   When you build your own copy of the player, 'main.s' is the one
   you should assemble.
   
   

2. Copying

   The sourcecode here is FREE to use and modify to your own needs.
   We would however be happy to receive a copy of eventual programs
   or demos that use it.
