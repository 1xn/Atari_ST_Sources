
Registering for foreign programmers :





The general concepts and guaranties remain the same as for the French Programmers, they 
are listed in CONTRAT.TXT; here is the main part to fix your memory :

The Visual Assembleur routines are generously spread all over the world so that 
programmers use them to create wonderful programs. The problem comes at the time 
when they want to spread their production over the world.

- If you intend to earn money with your program, you must ask for a register key and a 
serial number.
This can be done by filling the registration form in the REGISTER.TXT file, and 
sending it at the adress with an International Mandat worth 250 French Francs.
You will in return receive a printed manual, an E-mail hotline (and telephone but it will 
perhaps be a little bit expensive to call) and all the things listed in the file 
REGISTER.TXT

- If your product is to be spead over the world in a Freeware form then you must 
consider the Visual Assembler 4.0 as a shareware product and you should send us some 
money to encourage our efforts (let's say 50 French Francs minimum)



The documentation, as you can see, is in pure French BUT we will translate it for your 
country language, provided that :
. someone of our team can speak your language (actually ENGLISH and GERMAN 
are supported but the team grows by the minute !)
. there are more than 10 persons of the same language registered !
