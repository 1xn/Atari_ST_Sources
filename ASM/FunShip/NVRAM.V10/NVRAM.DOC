		NVRAM Version 1.0 By Atari Funship (c),at 24 October 1995
		---------------------------------------------------------


	Well, this program permit you to change the machine configuration. For it,
the software read the No Volatile RAM contents, display it to allow the user to change
what he wants and write the new congifuration if you are sure what's you done.
	You can also do a NVRAM reset.


	it work only for Atari TT and above (Falcon30); in fact the computers that
include the NVRAM chip compatible with the Atari's features.


Comments:
---------

	This NVRAM chip contents a total of 50 bytes and all of the locations are
	reserved for use by Atari and none are currently documented !!
	
	NVRAM is designed with the AADS library, and work correctly until AES 4.1.
	(See with MultiTos...)

How to translate it, in other language:
---------------------------------------

	Two ressource files permit NVRAM to "talk" in French and English, but if
	you are a German user, you can make a copy of NVRAM__G.RSC and translate all 
	english text in german.For fo it, copy NVRAM__G.RSC into NVRAM__D.RSC and
	make your translation.
	
		Don't forget to choice in your GEM ressource editor the object freeze 
	option before.(With INTERFACE, the option "Objektnummern fest").
	
	Well, when it done, NVRAM'll look for a NVRAM__D.RSC (D for Deutschland), cause
	your computer contents a german cookie indication.
	
	The same way can be do, for Spain and Italy( With NVRAM__S.RSC & NVRAM__I.RSC).
	
	
	(In fact, this nicely feature is supplied by the Aads library that it
	recognize automaticaly the active language and select the ressource file for it,
	when it is possible.)
	
	
	
	See you later...
