If you are producing modules that you want to spread to a broad public
of different computerusers and are using the players LANCE!4V or LANCE!8V,
here is a piece of advice for you:

When you have done the final version of your module you should disable UCDM
and reload all samples before saving the module.

The reason for this is that these players (in order to speed up the replay)
are using 7 or 6 bits samples instead of 8 bit samples.
The Octalyser is supporting this, and removes one or two bits, resulting
in lower quality on the samples. Since the output on an STE only is 8-bits
this doesn't make any difference in quality, but if the module is
played on a Falcon (or PC with 16-bit soundcard), these few extra bits
normaly should increase the soundquality. So if you want all Falcon and
PC users to get the best out of your module, you should reload the samples
before the final save (without having any of these two players activated!).
