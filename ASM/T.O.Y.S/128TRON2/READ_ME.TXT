The story:
One lazy Sunday PeyloW got bord and 
downloaded all 128bytes demos he could
find. Among them was a tron like game
but it was for one player only.
Oh what a shame becouse PeyloW felt
lik multitasking and play a game of
tron against himself. So what to do?
Well PeyloW sat down and coded a two
player Tron game for himself. The
original was 160 bytes (Not including
header). So PeyloW optimized and here
is the result. Do not let the license
agreement scare you away it is pretty
safe to try the game out anyway, just
read the agreement VERY carefully ;-)

The manual:
Start the game in two easy steps:
1) Set resolution to True-color and
   320*200 (RGB) or 320*240 (VGA).
2) Double click on the 128TRON2.TOS
   icon.
   
Controls:
	Player 1	Player 2
Up	Cursor up	Numeric 8
Down	Cursor down	Numeric 2
Left	Cursor left	Numeric 4
Right	Cursor right	Numeric 6

The extra:
The source code is included in a
folder cleverly named SOURCE. It is
there so that you can easy see how
PeyloW's brilliant mind works and so
you can enable the 128bytes+ yumyum
parts. The extra is the ability to
quit to the desktop and some nice
colors as well as having the 
background indicate the last rounds 
winner. Be warned thought enabling
these function will increase the size
of the program by 38 bytes and may in
worst case totaly fill up your fard-
drive. Ther rest of is explained in
the license agreement and in the
source code itself.


The end:
The best of luck to all of you from
PeyloW of T.O.Y.S.
