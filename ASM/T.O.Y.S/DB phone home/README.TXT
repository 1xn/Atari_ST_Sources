*--[ GENERAL ]--*
This game was never intended to be.  One night PeyloW screamed in
rage and turned his computer  off as the new paralax scroller for
Grubs just did not want to work. AiO looked at him with compasion
and lowered the whip; "You may have a short break..." he said and
PeyloW almost smiled,  "If you make a 4k Super mario clone! HA HA
HA MUAHAHA! HOHO HA!!" The evil AiO evil laughter rolled over the
mountains and a small tear rolled down PeyloWs chin.  "I can even
draw grafix and make a level editor!", AiO teased.  Desperate for
sleep  PeyloW  ones more booted the computer  and entered DevPac.
And many days later PeyloW is allowed to sleep and AiO is banging
his evil head into the wall muttering faul words.


*--[ THE STORY ]--*
One day DB and his alien  friends  was  out in the galaxy picking
flowers.  DB  found many many pretty flowers and totaly forgot to 
get back their ship.  Oh no poor DB is stranded on earth! DB must
now collect 6 phone cards to phone home.


*--[ GAME PLAY ]--*
Arrow keys controls movement.  left [Shift] jumps and [Alternate]
makes DB run just a bit faster.  You can not jump while swimming.
Picking up 25 singoalla (The yellow bisquits with a red dot) will
gain DB one extra life. Picking up a  Godis-Monstrets-bl†-hallon-
soda will make DB resist one hit fron an enemy or obstacle.


*--[ SOURCE CODE ]--*
Have fun and play alot. When tired of the game try out the source
code that ofcoz  is  included in the SOURCE folder.  It is poorly
documented in swedish and the level  editor  is made in AMOS.
The source is free and you m ay do whatever you want with it,
even base comersial software upon it. It is here just to give you
a chance to see how a genius mind works ;-)  
If you like to make a level editor of your  own  here is the file
format:

400 bytes of level blocks, one block per nibble.
1 word number of phone cards.
(Objekt 1)
1 word type
1 word X
1 word Y
1 word delta X
...
(Objekt n)
1 word type
1 word X
1 word Y
1 word delta X

1 long 0 (Zero/Null)
