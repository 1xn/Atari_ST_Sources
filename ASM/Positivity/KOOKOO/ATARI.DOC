             ---------------------------
   
   This little demo was coded by Dracula on july 1993.
   The demo features my fast line routine, which can
   go up to 17,5 diagonals per VBl.This is not the best
   one, so far, but it's still pretty good.
   The demo itself should run on all ST/STe/TT/Falcon,
   if you have any problem, if you see any bug, please
   inform me, it would be great.
   You will soon see a whole demo disk by me, with more
   stuff and also with all my routines. (line & poly routs)
   Hope you will enjoy it as i enjoyed writing it.
