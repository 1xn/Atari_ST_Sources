          This text explain how to use the poly_stx.s routines.
          -----------------------------------------------------      
    
    At first define the routine as an included routine:
  
{ Section TEXT
{polygone:
{  include	'path\poly_stf.s'
{
{ Section XXX

  Where XXX is the kind of stuff you want to have behind the routine.
  ( BSS,DATA or TEXT!)
  
  Then anywhere in the program, call the routine with the following
  parameters:  a0.l = adress of the ramvideo.
               a1.l = adress of the coords of the brows.
               d0.l = nb of brows.
               
  ( a0 should be a multiple of 2.)
                     
    BUT you should know that the polygone has to be convex!
  This mean that when you take 2 points in the poly, the segment
  defined by this 2 points is entirely in the poly.
  
           /\    This polygone      /\  This one is not!
          /  \   is convex    !    / /  ( concave! )
          \   \                   /  \
           \  /	                  \/\/
            \/
            
    And also  that the polygone has to be defined in trigonometrical
  way! This means that the second point is obtained by an anti-clockwise
  turn from the first point. ( around the center of the poly. )
  
  
          1 _____ 4  A good            1 _____ 2  And a bad one.
           |     |   definition         |     |
           |     |   for the brows.     |     |
          2 ----- 3                    4 ----- 3
          
    So, here is an example for the definition of the brows coords.
{brows:
{  dc.w	$00,$00
{  dc.w	$00,$2a
{  dc.w	$2a,$2a
{  dc.w	$2a,$00
{brows_nb:
{  dc.l	$4


    The x clipping of the polygone bugs if the polygone is too big,
  due to the fact that the x clipping is a trick I added after the
  routine was finished! ( Thanks Spearhead! )

    If you use the STe routine, the processor must be in supervisor
  mode, cos I access the registers of the blitter.
       
    I think that giving an example is a good idea, so see the file
  "use_poly.doc" for more.
  
                        Don't worry, be happy!
