          This text explain how to use the ball.s routine.
          ------------------------------------------------      
    
    At first define the routine as an included routine:
  
{ Section TEXT
{ball:
{  include	'path\ball.s'
{
{ Section XXX

  Where XXX is the kind of stuff you want to have behind the routine.
  ( BSS,DATA or TEXT!)
  
  Then anywhere in the program, call the routine with the following
  parameters:  a0.l = adress of the ramvideo.
               d0.w = x of the center.
               d1.w = y of the center.
               d2.w = horizontal size.
               d3.w = vertical size.
               
  ( a0 should be a multiple of 2.)
                     
    The x clipping of the ball bugs if the ball is too big, for the
  same reason than for the poly routine.
  
    Note that you must be in supervisor mode, cos I use the blitter
  to draw the big horizontal lines.

    See "use_ball.doc" to have an exemple of the use of the routine.
  
                        Don't worry, be happy!
