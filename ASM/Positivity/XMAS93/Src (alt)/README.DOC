                           Hello everybody!
                           ----------------
                           
     
     Here we are with a new demo disk, with plenty of stuff on it! Let's
 begin the day with a little trip into this disk:
 
        Folder  X_mas93        The executable, ice packed demo.
        File    dp6reset.prg   The demo I coded for the DNT Paper 6.
        Folder  docs           Explanations on how to use my polygone
                               and my ball routines.
        Other Folders          All the sources/datas, related to the 
                               parts of the X_mas93 demo.
                               
     Some important notes:
     ---------------------
        
 * If you want to install this demo on your harddisk, simply copy
   the whole X_mas93 folder in it! ( You can even rename the folder! )
 * If you spread this demo (Thanx!), spread it with all the files,
   do not copy only the executable. ( Hi Flips! )
 * Release date: Monday 13th of december,1993.
 * Commercial use of my routines is prohibited.
 * I'm not responsible for any damages this disk or one of its
   contents may cause.
 * This disk and all its contents are freeware, it may not be sold
   by anyone without a written agreement of the author.
 * Public Domain Libraries should write to me, Alain BROBECKER if
   they want this written agreement. ( Tell me the prices you
   practice, and send me your catalog. )
 * I'm looking out for 3.5K demos, so if you have some, it would
   be nice to send them to me. ( Disks will be send back, with
   some demo stuff on it! ) Also looking for normal demos.
 * Most of the screens were finished one month ago, but the "polishing"
   of the demo ( Endpart, images, bugs removal... ) and the school
   are taking loads of time.
   
     Ok, that's it, now enjoy the demo, have a Merry Christmas,
 and a happy New Year.
