Hello boys and girls !

These source-codes were done be me between 1988 and 1992.
After my first contact with Assembler on an old APPLE II+ I started
coding on my good old 1040 ST in the year 1988. My first attempts are
colected in this ZIP-File.

The files were written using the GFA Assembler Package but it should
be possible to assemble them with any other 680x0 Assembler Package.

The most files maybe interessting for BEGINNERS ONLY .
Expect not to much.
Some Routines expect 1 MB of free Ram.  

WARNING: You use this files on your own risk.
         I will take no responsibility for any damages
         that will ocure to your equipment.

Maybe I release my source-codes for the Falcon030 later.
