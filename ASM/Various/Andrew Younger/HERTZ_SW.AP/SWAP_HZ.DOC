  This is a small program which can be run either from the desktop,
or from inside the AUTO folder. What it does is to change the Screen
Hertz rate between 60 and 50 hertz. This has the effect ( when at 60
hertz to make the screen appear larger!)

PLEASE NOTE :- This program only works in low/medium resolution
               modes, if it is run in high resolution, it will
               display an error message.

And if
======
  ARGH! The screen has started spinning and doing weird things!
I'm afraid this is what happens when I tried it on my old black
and white. If this happens basically it means that this program
does not work with you television, to get your more stable display
back either reset or rerun the program. Remember that if it is
in an AUTO folder you will have to remove it from there, to stop
it running when rebooting that disk.


Liability
=========
  I personally think this bit of software is perfectly safe.
If you find out otherwise it is not my responsibility.
