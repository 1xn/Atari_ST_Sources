
     These are assembly listings  for  two  routines  to  read the mouse in
     absolute mode, at regular intervals, thus allowing stable rasters.

     'ABSMOUSE' limits the mouse  to  absolute  co-ordinates on the screen,
     whereas 'MOUSE2' keeps the mouse on a large grid (0-65535 in X and Y),
     and processes the position  to  give  the  relative movement since the
     last time the mouse was read.  As the mouse nears the edge of its vast
     limits, it is reset to the  centre  of  the range (resetting the mouse
     every time it is read  causes  loss  of  both position data and button
     press/release signals).

     The mouse origin is actually set  to  the bottom of the screen, simply
     to demonstrate how it is done.  This is not really necessary.

     The program 'MOUSE.PRG' is  actually  assembled from 'ABSMOUSE.S', but
     both listings, when assembled, appear to perform the same way.

     The border changes  colour  to  indicate  pressed  mouse  buttons, and
     pressing both mouse buttons together will exit.
