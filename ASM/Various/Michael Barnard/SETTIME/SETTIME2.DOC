    The usual conditions apply. I  can  take  no responsibility for how you
    may use this program, so try it out on something you can afford to lose
    first! DO NOT  BLAME  ME!  Also,  If  you  give  copies  to friends (or
    enemies) include the .DOC  file.  I've  thrown  the  source in for good
    luck.

    I've written this for myself, as I needed  to be able to set the clock.
    Whenever I save a file  it's  not  accurately  timestamped. Also when I
    spoke to a PD Library owner he could  not tell me how old a program was
    as IT wasn't timestamped. I  know  there  are many utilities out there,
    including the control panel(s), which can  set  the clock for me, but I
    don't use the rest of  the  gadgets  they  come  with, and they take up
    memory which is getting  more  expensive  every  day.  So, I decided to
    write my own.

    This is the second  version,  V1.02.  It  cures  a  couple of bugs, and
    changes the way the keys are used from  V1. But V1 shouldn't be in very
    many places anyway,  so  don't  worry  about.  Just  READ  the onscreen
    prompts and all will be right with the world.

    It's intended to go into the auto  folder of any discs that may require
    a saved file. Wordprocessors, Assemblers, Spreadsheets etc. If you save
    a file you may want to  know  how  old  it  is  or which version is the
    latest. I think I'm teaching you to suck eggs, aren't I!

    I've tried to make it  'user  friendly'.  Just  follow the prompts. The
    only thing I've not bothered to add is a check on the amount of days in
    the shorter months, so it'll believe you  when you say it's the 31st of
    February. But you wouldn't  do  that  would  you?  I might do something
    about that later, I'll see. It only uses  the 24 hour clock, so write 2
    a.m. as 0200, and 9 p.m. as 2100, etc.

    It doesn't matter where in the Auto  folder  it goes. Or you can double
    click on it from the desktop anytime you wish.

    A message to all assembler programmers who read this, and if you aren't
    a programmer but you know someone who  is please tell him. (Yes yes, or
    Her!). This is the first assembler program I've done that I've actually
    completed! Feels good. Bigger things are  coming.  I'd like to get into
    correspondence with anyone who's doing the  same as me, learning all on
    his/her own at home, with just  a  couple  of books for company. It's a
    slow way to learn. Maybe we  could swap ideas, routines, and knowledge?
    I think it's going to  be  the  only  way  to  keep  the ST alive, home
    programmers coming out with the programs that the software houses don't
    want to spend money on. Also, is  there  a utility or program you would
    find useful I could write?  (No,  I  can't  write  a cheaper version of
    Calamus. Maybe one day...).
