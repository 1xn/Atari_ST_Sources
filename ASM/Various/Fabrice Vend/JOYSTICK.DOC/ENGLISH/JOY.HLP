à DOC to use 4 joysticks on the enhanced joysticks port (STE/FALCON)Ä



àâ INTRODUCTION Ä
You have a STE or/and a FALCON and you would like to use the enhanced joysticks
ports (paddle or joypad) of your beautiful computer ?
Do you know that you can put 4 joysticks on these ports ?
It is the joystick type using in DYNA-BUSTER (and maybe others ???) a very
good game on STE/FALCON.
   With these files set we will explain you how to make the connections and to
 use
these joysticks. But if you don't want to make these connections and if you are
 coding a
game (with more than 2 player) try to use it in your game.
   We can put 2 joysticks on each port that it do 4 joysticks!!!
   So, please, don't try to make games with 2 players on the keyboard...



àâ'HARD' LEVELÄ


We must do an adaptator...

The list below show you the material to make ONE connector
which allow you to plug in TWO joysticks in the PADDLES port:

                                          approximate cost

   1 male DB15                          1 * 6.00 F     =  6.00 F

   2 male DB9                           2 * 4.00 F     =  8.00 F

   3 capots for DB9 OR      DB15        3 * 4.00 F     = 12.00 F

   TWO * x cm of wires with 6 wires    x * 10.00 f/m  =    ?
                                                       26 + x*10

   Rem : A minimum of x = 10 cm seems to be necessary, nethertheless  these
   adaptators allow, with some games,6 players in the same time, so it is
   better to have a good wire width.

   Two documents are available:

     - The ›diagram›cablage.txt› of the connections to make. It is a file which
     show you the numbers of the pins of the DB15 and DB9.
     It show too the link between these two connectors.

     - A ›picture›cablage.img› (1 DB15 on the left and 2 DB9 on the right) on
     very easy to understand show you the different wires to solder on the pins  .



àâSOFT LEVELÄ

   The use of the joysticks on the paddle port is very very easy, you have
just to read bits:
   - The ›positions›image1.img› of the joysticks can be read from the WORD
   at address $ff9202 (4 bits by joystick for up, down, left & right).


   - The ›Trigger state›image2.img› can be read from the nibble (4 bits) at
   address $ff9201 (low nibble) with on bit per joystick.

   - BUT PAY ATTENTION the sleep state is 1 (and no 0 as usually).



àâEXAMPLESÄ

   To understand easily this I have made 3 routines, one in ›gfa basic›joy.lst›
 one in ›assembler›joy.s› and the last one in ›C›joy.c›, which will allow you to
 tester your connector or to use it in your games. You can also test your
 joysticks
 with the wonderful DYNA-BUSTER). I have already use this joystick in my games
 and
 I often use it because it is easy to code (only read at an address) and more
 easy
 to plug in than the usual joysticks.



àâAlready finish ????Ä

   I hope you have understand and you will use these informations.
The programming of these joystick are the same like the Jaguar Joypad....
But never forget "NEVER 2 PLAYERS ON THE KEYBOARD ON FALCON" !!!!!
