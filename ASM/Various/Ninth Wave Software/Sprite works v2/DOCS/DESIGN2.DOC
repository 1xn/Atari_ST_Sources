                         ---------------
 
               Vertical and Multi-Directional Maps
               -----------------------------------
 
 
The second design program is used to design scrolling maps,  both 
vertical scrolling and multi-directional scrolling.  As with  the 
first map designer,  the map is built up from 16x16 pixel blocks. 
Any size map can be created as large as memory may  permit.  Each 
location of the map uses one long word (four bytes) which holds a 
pointer to the block to be printed and not a block number as  was 
the  case  in the first map designer.  Also there  are  no  flags 
contained  within the map data,  if flags are required then  they 
can  be created within this map designer then loaded  separately. 
If  you use flags then it will create a template file  with  each 
map location using one byte,  thus allowing 8 flag bits.  If  you 
are using a vertical type map then each 16x16 block will use  128 
bytes, but if you are designing a multi-directional map then each 
block will use much more memory:
 
        Pixel Scrolling    Size (Bytes)
                16             128
                8              384
                4              896
                2              1920
                1              3968
 
As you can see 1 pixel scrolling uses up nearly 4k per sprite  so 
is fairly impracticle to use unless you only have a few  sprites. 
The  reason  so much memory is used is because the  graphics  are 
pre-shifted.  This  means  that the graphics are rotated  to  the 
different  pixel positions before hand,  in the case of  1  pixel 
scrolling 15 extra copies are needed. 

NOTE:  The STE MAPPER command only needs graphics to be saved  in 
16  pixel (vertical) format as the STEs hardware copes  with  the 
single pixel bit rotations.

Vertical  maps can have up to 720 sprites  but  multi-directional 
maps are limited to 480 sprites, but as this will take up between 
180K to 1860K (depending on size of pixel scrolling) is  unlikely 
that they will all be used !

 
Main menu
---------
 
The  first  step is to select the size of the  map  by  selecting  
'SET SIZE',  the default size is the maximum square size that the 
available memory will permit.
 
The  map  graphics must then be loaded into screen banks  1-3  by 
selecting  'LOAD SCREEN 1-3'.  Remember that a vertical  map  can 
handle  three screenfuls of graphics but a multi-directional  map 
can  handle only two.  Map graphic files must be stored in  Degas 
Elite PC1 format but can be ICE packed.
 
Unlike  the first map designer the number of map sprites must  be 
set manually. Select 'SET SPRITES' then move the mouse and select 
the lowest/rightmost sprite. At the top left of the main menu the 
current width, height and number of sprites will be shown.
 
If  flags  are  to  be used then you can enter  a  flag  name  by 
clicking on the corresponding bit in the flag window on the  left 
side off the main menu.
 
There are two example maps that can be loaded :              

     Platform game: Load PLATFORM.MAP with 'LOAD MAP',            
     PLATFORM.FLG with 'LOAD FLAGS' and, SLUG_MAP.PC1 with        
     'LOAD SCREEN 1.                                              
     
     Racing game: Load RACER.MAP, RACER.FLG, RACER.PC1            

     All files can be found in the SOURCE folder                  
 
When  you have designed your map you must select the  appropriate 
scroll  type,  either  vertical or 8-way  (multi-directional)  by 
clicking on the scroll type button on the left of the main  menu. 
If  you are selecting 8-way then you must also select how  smooth 
the scrolling will be,  the default being 4 pixel scrolling.  You 
can  see  the  graphics size change at the bottom  right  of  the 
screen when you select the type.
 
The  graphics  are saved with 'SAVE GFX',  if you  have  selected 
vertical  scroll type then the graphics will be saved  instantly, 
but  if 8-way is selected then the graphics must be  pre-shifted. 
If  this  is the case then a countdown will be displayed  at  the 
bottom of the screen as the graphics are saved. If you have quite 
a  few sprites and smoother scrolling then it may take some  time 
to save.
 
At  the bottom of the screen are the memory requirements of  each 
file and of the files in total.  Take note of the total size,  if 
you  are designing a multi-directional map on a half meg  machine 
remember that you will need space to load GFA Basic !
 
Screen Editor
-------------
 
After selecting 'EDIT MAP' on the main menu you will be presented 
with a small menu at the bottom of the screen, similar to the one 
in the first map designer. It displays the current flag, x, y and 
sprite  number.  While the cursor is above the bottom menu a  box 
shows  your position and when in the bottom menu a cross hair  is 
shown  which allows you to select a flag or to exit to  the  main 
menu.  While above the menu you can draw the current sprite  with 
the left mouse button or select a new sprite with the right mouse 
button.
 
Selecting  a  new sprite takes you to a screen in which  you  can 
scroll up and down all of the sprites with the mouse. The size of 
the block can be altered with the cursor keys so that you can cut 
out a large block made up from a number of smaller sprites. Press 
the left mouse button to select a sprite or group of sprites  and 
press  the  right mouse button cancel and return  to  the  screen 
editor.
 
While on the screen editor you can use the cursor keys to  scroll 
around  the map if it is larger than the screen.  If you  have  a 
large map you can scroll faster by holding down one of the  SHIFT 
keys as you press the cursor keys.
 
When  you  have drawn your map you may want to set the  flags  to 
give attributes to the map locations.  To do this select the flag 
you require by selecting the appropriate arrow at the bottom left 
of the screen.  Then select the area between the arrows where the 
flag name is and the screen will change to the flag editor.
 
If a flag is set then the corresponding map location will have  a 
box drawn around it.  Simply draw with the mouse to set or  reset 
the  flags,  the  draw mode will toggle when the  first  flag  is 
selected.  ie,  when  you select an empty flag location the  draw 
mode  will set all other flags and selecting a set flag  location 
first  will reset the draw mode.  Select the right  mouse  button 
when you have finished to return to normal edit mode.

By  pressing the Clr key you can choose to clear the map  or  the 
flags.
 
When  you have completed designing your map and/or  flags  select 
exit  to get to the main menu and save the map,  graphics  and/or 
flags.
 
Map format
----------
 
The map data is stored as follows:
 
     Offset    Size
 
     0         W    Width in blocks
     2         W    Height in blocks
     4         W    Number of sprite blocks
     6         L    Graphics size (Used by map printer commands)
     10+            Map data
 
Each map location uses 4 bytes,  therefore the map data will  use 
4*(width*height) bytes.
 
The flag data has a 64 byte header,  then each location uses  one 
byte   and   the   total  size  of  the   flag   file   will   be  
(width*height)+64 bytes.
 
Maps  can be displayed using the commands v_mapper  for  vertical 
scrolling maps and mapper/ste_mapper for multi-directional scrol-
ling maps (see manual documentation).
 
Screen editor keys:
 
Cursor keys         Scroll map
