                     ------------------------


This  program  was developed because I believed that at  the  time 
there wasn't an easy to use sprite designer. Most sprite designers 
that  I have used usually consisted of creating a sprite within  a 
box with very limited drawing functions. At the same time most art 
packages  are  good for designing sprites but  offered  no  simple 
means of saving or animating the sprites. So I thought I'd combine 
the best of best worlds and came up with this program.  It has all 
the  usual  features  of any art package and also  allows  you  to 
animate and save your sprites for direct inclusion into GFA.  Also 
as  far  as  I know it is the only art package  to  allow  you  to 
activate  a x4 real time zoom at any time.  Cyberpaint did have  a 
real time zoom but you could only activate it before you  selected 
a  function.  It isn't until you start to use it that you  realise 
just  how  useful it is.  Also some time was spent on  the  detail 
magnify  modes which for sprite design will be the  most  commonly 
used feature.

Using Sprite Works Art Package
------------------------------

When the program is first run the main menu will automatically  be 
displayed.  Pressing  the right mouse button allows you to  toggle 
between the main screen and the menu.

Throughout the program the left mouse button is commonly used to
select and the right button to exit or deselect.

The  menu  will be drawn in the colour that provides  the  highest 
contrast,  typically  white on black or black on white.  Most  art 
packages  draw the menu in colour 15 but very occasionally  you'll 
come  across a palette where colour 15 is very close to  colour  0 
(the  background)  and  so the menu would be  very  hard  to  see. 
Sometimes after changing the palette the sub-menus may be drawn in 
a different colour to the main menu, this is because the main menu 
hasn't yet realised the menu colour has been changed.  Should this 
occur  simply deselect and reselect the main menu using the  right 
mouse button.
 
Menu Move
---------
 
At  the top left of the menu there is an icon which  can  be  used 
to move the menu around the screen.   There is not alot of use for  
this,  but if it wasn't there you'd be asking 'Why can't  you move 
the menu around ?'.
 
Information Bar
---------------
 
By   selecting   the  top of the menu where  'SPRITE   WORKS'   is 
written an information window is displayed.
 
Colour Select
-------------
 
On   the   right   side of the main menu  are   the   16   colours 
available. Simply select which colour you want and a marker at the 
side of the colours will be displayed.
 
Screen Select & Copy
--------------------
 
The  six workscreens are represented near the bottom of  the menu.  
To  select  a  new workscreen simply  click  on  the   appropriate 
number.  To  copy from screen to screen you must press  the  mouse 
button  briefly on the source screen and drag the box over to  the 
destination screen. You can copy the screen, palette or both.

On  a half meg machine make sure that you have no  accessories  or 
resident  programs,  this  should  give  you  two  available  work 
screens.  For one meg or more machines you should have no  trouble 
in accessing all six workscreens.
 
Block
-----
 
Selecting  block from the main menu will bring up a sub   menu  of  
various   functions.   The first function is to   toggle   whether 
block mode is on or off. If the block mode is on then the draw and 
fill  functions  on  the main menu will  use  the  current  block. 
Without  bringing up the main menu the block mode can  be  toggled 
with the 'B' key.

Cut Box (or ESC key) and Cut Circle can be used to  copy  an  area 
of  screen into the cut buffer.  For Cut Box select the  top  left 
point  of  the box and drag to the bottom right.  For  Cut  Circle 
select  the middle of the circle and then drag out to the  desired 
radius.
 
Cut  Shape allows you to cut out an irregular shape.  Simply  draw 
the shape you want to cut out and release the mouse button to join 
the last point to the first point.   Then click on the part of the  
image  you   want to cut  out,   either inside or outside  of  the 
shape that  you drew.  There will  then  be a slight  delay as the 
shape is cut.
 
Erase,   Solid,   X-Ray,  Mask and Inv Mask are used to define how  
the   cut   buffer will be placed on the screen   when   draw   is 
selected  and block mode is on.  Erase will cause the block to  be 
placed  on screen as the background colour.  Solid will place  the 
block as the original block, while X-Ray will cause the background 
colour to be transparent.  Mask and Inv Mask are used for creating 
masks  for sprites.  The 'E' key can be used to cycle through  the 
different modes while drawing.
 
Merge  has now been added which logically ORs the block  with  the 
screen.  This is designed to allow selected bitplanes to be  moved 
and merged with the screen. This is to be used in conjunction with 
the Planes function.
 
Planes will allow you to select any of the four bit planes of  the 
block  that you wish to keep.   A sub-menu will display  the  bit-
planes with a tick by them if they are to be kept. Press the right
mouse  button to  exit.  The sprite  will then  be stripped of the
unwanted planes but the mask remains unaltered.
 
Stretch   allows   you  to enlarge or   reduce   a   block.   When 
selected  you  will  be  presented with  a  new  screen  with  the 
current width and height and the original width and height of  the 
block displayed.  Use the mouse to drag the block into a new shape 
and select when you wish to change the size. Hold down the altern-
ate  button to  give a  proportional  size of the  original block.
Press right mouse button to exit.
 
Rotate allows you to rotate a block 0-359 degrees and as an  added 
bonus  you can also enlarge and reduce the  block  proportionally. 
Move  the  mouse around the screen to get the  desired  angle  and 
press  '-' or '+' on the main keyboard to alter  the  size.  Press 
right mouse button to exit.  If you are rotating a sprite you will 
probably  want to keep the original width and height.  If this  is 
the  case then hold down the ALTERNATE button when you  press  the 
right mouse button, this will keep the sprite correctly centered.
 
Recolour  will try to redraw the block with the  current  palette. 
This  is used when transfering a block from one screen to  another 
which has a different palette.
 
Draw
----
 
If  block mode is off a cross-hair will be displayed and  you  can 
draw in the selected colour.  In block mode the cross-hair will be 
replaced  by the current block in the cut buffer.  To toggle  edge 
clipping  press the 'TAB' key.  Also while in block mode  you  can 
flip the block horizontally or vertically by the 'H' and 'V'  keys 
respectively.
 
Spline
------
 
The spline is actually a four point Bezier curve.  You must select 
four control points, the curve will be drawn between the first and 
last  points  with the second and third points acting  as  control 
points.  When you have selected all four points the curve will  be 
displayed  but it will not be stored on the current  screen  until 
the right mouse button is pressed.  At this point you can move any 
of  the points by selecting a control point and while keeping  the 
mouse  depressed,  drag the control points to move the curve  into 
the desired position.
 
Line
----
 
To  draw a line,  select the first point and drag the line to  the 
end position and release the mouse button.
 
Circle & Disc
-------------
 
Select the centre and drag the circle to the correct size.  Circle 
draws  an outline and Disc draws a solid,  you can toggle  between 
these by pressing the left 'SHIFT' key.

The  default  of  this function is to actually  draw  an  ellipse, 
should you want a perfect circle, keep the 'ALT' key depressed.

Frame & Box
-----------
 
Select  the  first corner and drag the box to the  required  size. 
Frame  draws  an outline and Box draws a  solid,  you  can  toggle 
between these, as with Circle & Disc, by pressing the left 'SHIFT' 
key.
 
 
Fill
----
 
Simply  select  the x/y coordinate to fill and  the  current  fill 
pattern  at bottom left of main menu will be used.  To change  the 
fill pattern select the bottom left window and a sub-menu of  fill 
patterns  is  displayed.  The  first two lines  are  general  fill 
patterns,  the third line of patterns are for reference grids  and 
the bottom two lines are 16 colour fills which are not affected by 
the current selected colour.
 
If the block mode is on then the current block will be used as the 
fill  pattern acting as a user-defined fill pattern.  The  smaller 
the block the longer the fill will take.
 
Poly
----
 
To draw a polygon, select the points of the polygon and then press 
the  right  mouse button (a line is automatically drawn  from  the 
last  to first point).  You can now move points of the polygon  by 
dragging  the control points which have small boxes  around  them. 
When  you  are satisfied with the polygon simply press  the  right 
mouse button again. The default is to draw the polygon as a series 
of  lines,  but  if you want a solid polygon then press  the  left 
'SHIFT' key to toggle the fill.  If you are drawing a large  solid 
polygon the program  will slow down considerably, so turn the fill 
off  until the points are in the correct place then turn the  fill 
on again before pressing the right mouse button.
 
Brush
-----
 
This function had to be written slightly different from the others 
because  it  had  to run very fast.  Because of  this  you  cannot 
activate the real-time zoom as you draw,  but have to release  the 
mouse button before you zoom in with the 'Z' key.
 
The current brush is shown above the text window on the main menu. 
To select a new brush, select this window and choose a new brush.
 
Text
----
 
To alter text size select the appropriate direction from the  text 
window  at the bottom right.  While text is being entered you  can 
move the text around with the mouse and delete any characters with 
the 'BACKSPACE' key. Obviously you cannot enter the real-time zoom 
mode ('Z' key) as it will be interpreted as a 'z' character.
 
You  can  alter  the text attributes and the  fonts  (if  GDOS  is 
installed) by selected the bottom right text window. If you do not 
have GDOS there are PD equivalents with hundreds of fonts availab-
le, up to 11 fonts can be loaded.
 
Sprite
------
 
Used for saving sprite data.  Select the sprite width and  height, 
then  the  first and last sprite.  The amount of memory  that  the 
sprites use is displayed on the left.  Sprites are taken from  the 
current screen,  and only one screen may be used.  If your sprites 
cover  a  number of screens then you must brake them down  into  a 
number of files.
 
REMEMBER:  Make sure that you have created a mask underneath  each 
of the sprites.
 
Animate
-------
 
This  produces  a sub-menu of the  following  functions:  animate, 
joystick,  mouse,  sequence,  reverse,  start, end, delay, screen, 
width and height.
 
Animate is used to start animation of the current sequence on  the 
current  screen.   If  mouse  is  select  then  the  animation  is 
continuous  and  you can move the sprite around  with  the  mouse, 
terminating with a mouse click.  If joystick is selected then  the 
animation  is  only  updated when the joystick is  moved  and  the 
sprite  is moved in the appropriate direction and  termination  is 
with the fire button.
 
To set up a sequence you MUST have a start, end, screen and height 
set.  First set the width of either 16 or 32 pixels.  Then  select 
height and a grid will appear.  Move the mouse up and down so that 
the  grid  matches the height of the sprites  (not  including  the 
mask).  Now select start and end and move the surrounding box onto 
the corresponding start and end sprites. Make sure that the screen 
value  is  the same as the sprite screen number and then  set  the 
delay time (which is in 50th of a second steps,  a value of around 
3-4 should be fine).  When you animate, the sprites will appear on 
your  current workscreen which makes it ideal for mapping  sprites 
onto a screen from your game. To make a number of different sprite 
animations simply select a new sequence, up to a maximum of 99 can 
be created.
 
Sprites MUST have a mask, which is made by cutting out the sprites 
and selecting MASK mode from the block menu or by pressing the 'E' 
key  until  the correct mode is found.  Place  the  mask  directly 
underneath  the  sprites  so  make  sure  that  your  sprites  are 
separated  vertically  by twice the sprites height  (there  are  a 
number of example files in the SOURCE folder sub-directories).
 
Save
----
 
Eight  different  formats can be  saved;  Neochrome  (NEO),  Degas 
(PI1),  Degas Elite (PC1), Crackart (CA1), Data (DAT), Interchange 
Format (IFF),  Palette data (PAL) and also Sprite Animation  Files 
(SAF).  From the save menu you can also delete a file and format a 
disk.
 
The  DAT  format is a raw data format and simply saves  the  32000 
bytes of screen data.  This replaced the IMG in previous  versions 
which may of been confused with existing IMG formats.  If you have 
saved  any IMG files from previous versions of Sprite  Works  then 
simply rename them with a .DAT extension.
 
The  PAL file is used to include palettes into your own  programs. 
Simply load the palette into an INLINE statement and use XBIOS  to 
set the palette, eg
          
          INLINE palette%,32       <- load your palette file here
          ~XBIOS(6,L:palette%)     ! Set the palette
 
The  SAF  file  contains all the data  entered  on  the  animation 
menu. It  holds 99 records of 7 bytes and is used only  by  Sprite 
Works for animation purposes.

NOTE:  When  saving a file the extension is automatically set  and 
the  previous name of the file loaded into the current  screen  is 
used.

Load
----
 
Ten different formats can be loaded into Sprite Works; NEO, PI1, 
PC1,  IFF,  CA1, TNY/TN1, DAT, PAL , SAF and Animaster Sprite Bank 
(ASB).  A  note about  ASB files is that it can only  fit  sprites 
onto one screen and will chop off the rest if there are too many.
 
NOTE:   The  IFF loader isn't terribly robust,  but it  will  load 
files  from Deluxe Paint.  It won't be able to cope with  pictures 
with more then 16 colours or a different resolution to 320x200.
 
Snap
----
 
When  in block mode the 16 and 32 pixel snaps come in very  handy. 
Snap  is  used to move the cursor to the nearest  x/y   coordinate 
that is divisable by the snap value.

NOTE:  The edge clipping does not operate while snap is activated.  

Palette
-------
 
This  function is used to change any colour of  the  palette.  The 
sub-menu  shows  3 sliders,  16 colours and a default  and  preset 
settings. The sliders represent the red, green and blue components 
of the current colour,  select the up or down arrows to change the 
values.  Default  is  used  to change the colours  back  to  their 
original  values  and  the preset values are  used  to  substitute 
palettes  which  have  already been created.  Once  you  exit  the 
palette menu the default palette becomes the current palette.  You 
can  copy  from  one colour to another by  dragging  the  required 
colour.
 
By  double  clicking  on a colour you can bring up  a  512  colour 
picker.  Press left mouse button to select colour or right  button 
to cancel.

If you have an STE then the colour sliders will display the values 
0-15 in hexidecimal (0,1,2,..,D,E,F).
      
FX
--
 
A couple of miscellaneous routines are placed on this menu.
 
SORT  will rearrange the palette so that the colours are in  order 
of  contrast.  It  takes  a second or two  as  the  bitplanes  are 
reconfigured.
 
BLACK/WHITE  will change the palette into black and  white  shades 
which will have the equivalent contrast of the original colours.
 
VIEW  BITPLANES  will  display a tiny menu at the  bottom  of  the 
screen  which  allows you to select which bitplanes  are  visable. 
This does not affect the actual image,  only the display.
 
Detail Zoom
-----------
 
For  sprite  design this will be the most commonly  used  feature. 
Simply press the F-key corresponding to your desired magnification 
(F1=x3 to F6=x8).  After selecting the window position you will be 
displayed  the the actual size portion of screen on the  left  and 
the magnified part of the screen on the right.  You can select the 
pen  colour from the right side of the screen or a quicker  method 
is  by pressing the right mouse button on the required  colour  in 
the  magnified  part of the screen.  Along the top  right  of  the 
screen  you  can scroll the window by  selecting  the  appropriate 
arrow,  or you can use the cursor keys.  In the right corner is  a 
toggle for the grid which is overlaid on the magnified screen.
 
By  pressing  the  ALTERNATE key while selecting a  pixel  on  the 
magnified screen you can fill the portion of screen in the current 
pen colour.  To exit the zoom move the cursor to the left side  of 
the screen and press the right mouse button twice.
 
You can also draw a checkerboard pattern by holding down the  LEFT 
SHIFT  key or CONTROL key while drawing.  These keys allow you  to 
draw  either  on the white or black squares  of  the  checkerboard 
respectively which make it ideal for dithering purposes.
 
Real Time Zoom
--------------
 
Another useful feature of this art package is that you can at  ANY 
time magnify the screen by a factor of 4.  This allows you to work 
in greater detail for cutting blocks, drawing lines, circles, etc. 
To toggle the real time zoom use the 'Z' key.  While in zoom  mode 
you  can also scroll around by using the cursor keys allowing  you 
to view a different portion of the screen to that of the cursor.

Program History
---------------

Additions to version 1.1
------------------------
 
* The resize option now has proportional resizing by holding down
  the alternate button.
* A correction in the cut block function means that a block will
  appear in the same place it was cut out. Previously the block
  would be shifted back and up by one pixel.
* The program now loads in medium resolution although the GEM
  drawing functions will not draw in colours 4-15. These include
  draw, circle, disc, box, frame and poly. Fill, brush and detail
  zoom colours are unaffected.
* On the palette menu you can now copy from one colour to another
  by dragging from one box to another.
 
Additions to version 1.2
------------------------
 
* A bug in 1.1 meant that the first couple of colours were corrupted
  when the picture was saved ... whoops. Now fixed.
* The palette now has a 512 colour picker, and the copy colour routine
  was rewritten.
* GDOS fonts and selectable attributes have now been added.
* Selectable bitplanes for screen and block and a merge mode for the
  block function have been added. Useful for some, meaningless to
  others !!!
* When you rotate an object you can keep the original dimensions by
  holding down ALT when you exit the rotater.
* Loading and saving IMG files.
* Automatic file extensions, avoids you having to re-type the file type
  extension when you save a file.
 
Additions to version 1.3
------------------------
 
* Coordinates can now be toggled on/off for any command.
* Splines and polygons have been slightly improved for more accurate
  placing.
* Checkboard dithering can be achieved in detail zoom mode with the
  CONTROL and LEFT SHIFT keys.
* The animate with joystick bug has been fixed.
* You can now cut irregular shapes.
* IMG format changed to DAT format.
* Crackart and Tiny formats added.
* Most of the key functions now work at any time.
* ICE packed (2.4) files can be loaded.
* Takes advantage of STE palette and blitter chip.
