                          --------------

                    Non-scrolling Map Designer
                    --------------------------
 

This  map  designer  is for use with flip-screen  or  puzzle  type 
games.  Screens  are constructed from 16x16 pixel blocks of  which 
720  can  be used.  The screen area can range from  1x1  to  20x12 
blocks,  these screens can only be displayed in full and cannot be 
scrolled.  Each  map block or location uses one word  (two  bytes) 
which  hold the sprite block number and the user  flags.  You  are 
allowed up to six flags to give attributes to each location (these 
will be explained later).
 
Main menu
---------
 
To  use  the map designer first set your map area  with  the  'SET 
SCREEN' command.  This will allow you to change the size from  1x1 
to 20x12 squares which represent 16x16 - 320x192 pixels.
 
Once  the  size  is set you can load in  your  map  graphics.  The 
graphics must be arranged from left to right, top to bottom within 
16x16 pixel boundaries.  Unlike the SPRITE WORKS sprites these  do 
not need masks. Make sure that you do not have any empty locations 
between  the  sprites.  The reason for this is  that  the  program 
automatically  checks each location to see whether there  are  any 
graphics in them and stores them in memory.  The map graphics must 
be  in  Degas Elite PC1 format and must be loaded in  sequence  to 
screens  1,2 and 3 on the main menu.  Graphics will only  take  up 
more than one screen if the previous screen is COMPLETELY full  of 
16x16 sprite blocks (240 of them).
 
There is one example that can be loaded :

     Load in the file SLUG.MAP with 'LOAD MAP' and SLUG_MAP.PC1
     with 'LOAD SCREEN 1'. This will provide an example to be
     used as reference.                                                      *

     These files can be found in the SOURCE\SLUG_BLA.ST\ folder.
 
After  loading  a  screen the number of sprites  counted  will  be 
displayed on the main menu. 
 
To select a screen to edit,  select the arrows on the edit control 
or  select the area between the arrows to enter the screen  number 
manually. Select 'EDIT SCREEN' to change to the screen editor.
 
The number of screens currently designed is also shown on the main 
menu. When you select 'NEW SCREEN' you will be taken to the screen 
editor and the number of screens is increased.
 
The  flags bits are used to give attributes to each map  location. 
In the example you can see that two flags are used, SOLID and SEMI 
SOLID which represent the 11th and 12th bits of the word  location 
respectively.  The  game  uses these bits to see whether  you  are 
standing on a solid or semi solid location,  or whether you hit  a 
solid while walking.  In this example the word location is used as 
follows.
 
     Bit  15 14 13 12 11 10 9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1 0
                      |  |  |                         |
                     /   \   \---- Sprite Number ----/
                   /       \
         SEMI SOLID         SOLID
 
Run the file PRINTMAP.GFA to understand this slightly better.
 
After  designing your screens,  use 'SAVE MAP' and 'SAVE  GFX'  to 
save the map data and the map graphics.
 
At the bottom of the menu the total memory is shown.  This is  how 
much memory is used by the map data AND the map graphics.
 
Screen Editor
-------------
 
At the bottom of the screen editor the flag,  screen number,  x, y 
and sprite number are shown.  While the cursor is above the bottom 
menu  a box shows your position.  When you  select the left  mouse 
button  the current sprite number is placed at that  location.  To 
change the sprite press the right mouse button. This will bring up 
the  map graphics so that you change then select your sprite  with 
the left mouse button.  You can also select a block of sprites  by 
increasing  the height and width of the box with the cursor  keys. 
By  pressing keys 1-3 you can change to the  corresponding  screen 
back where the graphics were loaded into.
 
When you have drawn your screen you will want to set the flags. To  
do  this you must select which flag you require by  selecting  the 
appropriate  arrow at the bottom of the screen.   Select  the area 
between  the  arrows  and  the screen will be redrawn  with  boxes 
corresponding  to whether the map location  has  had the flag  set 
or  reset.   Draw on the  screen  to set/reset  the map  locations 
then press the right mouse button  to exit. See the example map to 
see how the solid and semi-solid flags have been positioned.
 
You  can scroll through the screens that you've designed by  using 
the left and right cursor keys.
 
Should  you make a mistake you can press UNDO which  will  restore 
the  screen to the state before your current draw.  You  can  also 
clear the current flags or map by pressing the CLR key which  will 
provide an alert box to choose the type you want to clear.

You can also delete a screen by pressing DELETE or insert a screen 
by pressing INSERT. When you insert a screen the current screen is 
left as it is providing a copy of the original screen.

There  is also a primitive copy/paste feature which allows you  to 
copy the entire screen. Press 'C' to copy and 'P' to paste.

When you have designed your screen and set the appropriate  flags, 
exit to the main menu and save your map data.
 
Map format
----------
 
Each screen takes up 2*(width*height) bytes.  In the example  file 
the  screen  size is 20x12 which means that it uses  480  bytes  a 
screen.
 
The  first two words of the map file contain the width and  height 
of the screen.
 
The  next 48 bytes contain the flag names which are only  used  by 
the map designer for reference.
 
Each screen is then sequentially stored.
 
     Offset    Size
 
       0       W    Width
       2       W    Height
       4       48   Six flag names
       52+          Screens
 
When  printing  the map using the command  print_map  (see  manual 
documentation)  you   supply the address of the map data  and  the 
command  will  get the width and height and skip over the 48  byte 
flag names

Screen editor keys:

Cursor keys         Move to next/previous screen
Clr/Home            Clear map or flags
Delete              Delete current screen
Insert              Insert a screen at current position
Undo                Restores last action
C                   Copy screen to buffer
P                   Paste from buffer to screen
