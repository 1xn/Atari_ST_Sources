Thank  you for purchasing Sprite Works.  My aim with this package is to  provide 
everything  you'll  ever  need  to  write a game in  GFA  Basic  as  well  being 
invaluable to any budding assembler programmer or demo coder.  Version 2 now has 
111 (!) extra commands for GFA,  some of which you will not have encountered  in 
any  other  language  (such as pixel  explosions,  sprite  scaling,  STE  screen 
splitter, I could go on ...).

Now that you're the proud owner of Sprite Works I must ask you one small favour. 
PLEASE REGISTER YOUR COPY BY SENDING YOUR NAME,  ADDRESS  AND PLACE OF  PURCHASE
ON A POSTCARD OR THE BACK OF A SEALED ENVELOPE. THANKYOU.

Hopefully Sprite Works will become known as a good alternative to STOS and  will 
get a decent user base.  It will be nice to see PD libraries gain an  increasing 
number  of Sprite Works based programs.  If you have any code or tips  that  you 
think other users would like to hear about then please contact me.

Disk One Contents:

        \68000          Assembly source code for all commands.
                        Because of the size (>200k) the assembly
                        listings are stored in a self-extracting
                        archive. Copy the 68000.TOS file to a
                        blank formatted disk or spare partition
                        and run the program.
        \DOCS           All the documents in ASCII format.
        \INLINES        All the INLINE data and LST setups. 
        \SP_WORKS       Sprite Works art package and sample editor.
        \FONTS          Font screens.
        \DESIGNER.MAP   Two map designer programs.
        \PROPAGAN.DA    Latest OCL details.

Disk Two:

        \EXAMPLES       GFA programs to demonstrate just about
                        all of the new commands in action.
        \SOURCE         Example related files and also contains more
                        practical source listings for games and demos.        

If you get stuck with any part of this package,  need some programming advice or 
need a routine written in assembly the write to me,  my address is at the bottom 
of this document. (A S.A.E would be appreciated if you do write, thanks)

Please try to run the programs in low resolution. The programs do work in medium 
resolution but some will mess up colour wise or when using GEM.

You can use any of the code on these disks in your own programs,  be they PD  or 
shareware, but please do not use the graphics.

Any views or opinions expressed in the programs or documents are not necessarily 
those of the management or anyone else for that matter.

compiler (why did you but this product then !) you can contact them at :

IMPORTANT:

Should you release a program using any part of Sprite Works then please state in 
the program or documentation that you have used 'Sprite Works'.

Also if any source code is released into Public Domain then DO NOT leave code in 
the INLINE statements.  Either clear the INLINEs or better still,  have the data 
BLOADed  into the program so that only Sprite Works users with DISK ONE can  run 
the programs.
