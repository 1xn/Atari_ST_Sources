                    OCL001- Dead or Alive...?

Written by: Kev Davis                   Released: 13/05/1992
Category: Text adventure                Drive requirements: D/S
Memory requirements: 1/2 Meg            Version number: 2.0

                          Price - œ3.00
 
      Just  when  you thought your life as  a  private  detective 
couldn't get any worse...  it ended. Rather messily. Being rudely 
awoken  from the dead the next morning is only the first of  your 
many  problems as you trek around the town of Malton and  venture 
beyond to kill your assassin in Kev Davis's highly acclaimed  and 
bloody difficult comedy adventure. Recommended for both beginners 
and hardened adventuring veterans alike.
     This is the concentrated,  fat-digesting, cool-tasting, non-
bleaching,  thirst-quenching,  low-alcohol,  seventy-two calorie, 
best-ever chocolate, tartare-scraping, eco-bagged, realistically-
MIG-sound-effected,  interactive fiction version of the game, the 
few bugs lurking in the old version have been killed - dead.

     Dead  will run on single-sided drives,  but you'll  need  to 
find a double-sided drive in order to transfer the relevant files 
onto two disks (instructions on disk).

     (Note:  Dead  was sold by Budgie UK from September 91  until 
April  92.  If you've got that version (with the lovely  "packing 
crate falling out of a rockfall and nailing itself to the  floor" 
bug intact), you're perfectly entitled to send the disk to OCL HQ 
and claim an update.)


      "Very tongue in cheek.  I ended up revelling in  its  sheer 
silliness.  If  you enjoy a good laugh then look no further  than 
Dead or Alive...?" - Neil Shipman, Syntax Magazine (preview).

     "An  excellent example of what a good adventure  should  be. 
Loads of puzzles, great responses, good parsing, many jokes and a 
very polished front end. It plays almost like an Infocom game. If 
you  are  an  adventure  player then  get  this  game!"  -  Colin 
Campbell, Syntax Magazine (88%)

     "Weird!  Have  a  look if you fancy a little bit more  of  a 
challenge."  - Chicken (apparently),  ST Action (who  don't  give 
percentages, for reasons known only to themselves)

     "An atmospheric text adventure... The author's surreal sense 
of  humour pervades every aspect of the game from  the  sarcastic 
comments  you  get  from  the  parser  to  some  dowright   silly 
situations. If you thought text adventures were dull, get Dead or 
Alive and you may be forced to change your mind... Take a walk on 
the wild side and pop down to the local graveyard." - Somone, STF 
(83%)      

     "As text adventures go,  Dead or Alive is a good one...  The 
difficulty  is  quite high,  but things get far easier  once  you 
begin  to  appreciate  the  author's  twisted  sense  of  humour! 
Numerous nice touches." - Nial Grimes, ST Review (four stars)

     "A  decent adventure.  Cute footnotes." - Matthew  Robinson, 
Shareware and PD Shopper (five stars - maximum)

      (Cute???!)



               OCL002- Murder on the Orion Express

Written by: Kev Davis                   Released: 13/4/1993
Category: Comedy-murder-strategy        Drive requirements: D/S
Memory requirements: 1/2 Meg            Current version: 666

                          Price - œ3.00

      The  world's  first  ever  comedy-murder  graphically-based 
mousie-driven  game.  Dare  you take on the role of  a  detective 
aboard  the Orion Express?  When all but eight of the  passengers 
die simultaneously,  and the crew are gradually bumped off as the 
night progresses,  it's your job to sort things out.  Armed  only 
with  an electronic notebook,  you must trudge around  the  ship, 
interrogate the people on board and use your skill and  judgement 
to  work  out  "whodunnit"  (and other  tired  clich‚s)  in  this 
bizarrely humorous "Cluedo-meets-2001-meets-Red Dwarf-meets-Hitch 
Hiker's-meets-Monty  Python" as I used to say before I found  out 
about copyright laws.

     Orion  has  a  free  five-thousand-odd  word   comedy-sci-fi 
novella  thrown  in just for the hell of it,  centring  around  a 
series of unwieldy events aboard the Express.

     The  game  -will- run from S/S drives - you've just  got  to 
delete  everything except the PRG file and the game  data  files, 
and copy it over to a S/S disk.  Easy as three point one four one 
five nine two seven something.

     [The  words  "interactive fiction" haven't been  applied  to 
this blurb,  since the phrase applies to every computer game ever 
written.]


     "If  you're a Cluedo fan,  be sure to get hold of Murder  on 
the Orion Express - it's better acted than the TV programme and a 
lot  more  challenging  than the board  game!  There's  a  strong 
thread  of humour running through the game and it's very  much  a 
parody of more serious commercial software.  If you enjoy a  good 
laugh,  Orion comes recommended." - Nial Grimes,  ST Review (four 
stars)

     "It's  basically one big logic puzzle...  It's well  screwed 
together  and  there are plenty of humorous  touches  to  lighten 
things up." - Someone, STF (75%)


     We've  had some interest regarding the Orion T-shirts  -  if 
anyone  else  wants  to  put their name down  for  one  of  these 
exclusive   garments  (featuring  the  Orion  logo  on  a   black 
background),  contact OCL HQ and we'll get back to you.  Send  no 
money now.  These articles are not available in the shops. And so 
on.

                      OCL003 - Sprite Works

Written by: Terry King                  Released: 7/10/1993
Category: GFA Extension / Art Package   Drive requirements: D/S
Memory requirements: 1/2 Meg            Current version: 1.22

                          Price - œ7.00


     Sprite Works is a powerful new set of commands available for 
GFA Basic - Versions 3 and above.  Essentially for games writers, 
the  kit  also provides a professional edge to  any  program.  It 
turns GFA into a games language that can produce results that can 
equal  and  possibly better those managed through  STOS.  38  new 
commands  are  provided,  as well as a superb  art  package  that 
allows easy sprite design, and two map designers.

     Extra GFA commands include:-

          * Fast  sprites - 16x and 32x  widths with  a  variable 
               height  up  to  48  pixels,   sprite  handler  and 
               variable clipping
          * Low processor time sample player - 2.5-15 KHz
          * Multi-directional and vertical scrolling maps
          * Non-scrolling, multi-screen maps
          * New fonts - 20, 40 and 64-column widths
          * Program speed regulator
          * Depacker for ICE and AUTOMATION packers
          * Mirror copy
          * Fast screen clear and copy
          * Fast screen line copy
          * New mouse controller
          * Palette switching (32 colours on-screen)
          * Banner scrolling (with an option for running them  on 
               interrupt whilst disk accessing or something)
          * Degas Elite compressor and decompressor
          * Spectrum 512 displayer

     Also  a must for any budding assembly programmers,  as  full 
68000 assembly source for all the commands is included.

     The art package includes six fast zooms,  full-screen  real-
time zoom, animation preview, an option to save sprites in ready-
to-use  format,  controllable splines and polygons,  loading  and 
saving in numerous formats,  and has fast  resizing,  recolouring 
and block rotation. Half meg and full meg versions are included.

     Two map designers come with the package, one for flip-screen 
maps and one for non-scrolling maps.  Each are fully featured and 
allow  the  easy  use of "flags" for each  screen  block  to  aid 
collision detection.

     Sprite Works comes on two disks, with full documentation and 
annotated GFA examples of the commands, as well as GFA source for 
the  three  games  and the two demo programs given  away  on  the 
Freebie disk.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
                         F R E E B I E S
-----------------------------------------------------------------

     Before spending your hard-earned/stolen wealth on one of the
OCL  titles,  you  might  like  to  get  hold  of  a  nearly-free 
demonstration disk, to give you some idea what you'll be buying. 

     Freebie  bundles  are only available from  OCL  Headquarters 
itself,  or from the software's programmer - all addresses are in 
the  OCLADDRS.DOC  somewhere.  Please enclose a blank  disk  when 
writing for a Freebie - if we gave out disks to anyone who wanted 
them,  we'd  soon  run  out of money.  And whilst  an  SAE  isn't 
entirely essential, you'll get a far swifter reply than you would 
get without one. 

     It's possible to get more than one Freebie bundle on a disk, 
so if one of our authors is offering two Freebies that'll fit  on 
the  same  disk,  you can  request  both.  And,  of  course,  OCL 
Headquarters can offer you a blend of any Freebies you like.

     Oh - mention if you want a double or single-sided  disk,  by 
the way. Just to be sure.


FREEBIE001 - Sprite Works (331k)

     This  bundle contains two rather swish demos (both coded  in 
GFA with bits from Sprite Works) and three demo games - an  8-way 
scrolling platform game, a flip-screen platform and an above-view 
driving game;  all are coded in GFA with the aid of Sprite Works, 
and  give  a stunning example of what you can achieve  using  the 
package.
     A  cut-down version of the Sprite Works art package is  also 
included.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

                             UPDATES

     If  you  own  an  earlier version  of  a  game  that's  been 
mentioned  above,  you  can  claim a completely  free  update  by 
sending your *original* game disk to the programmer.  An SAE will 
guarantee  a far swifter reply than a non-existent SAE,  I  might 
add.  Oh,  and the OCL programmers reserve the right to keep your 
disk and ignore you completely if you send them an old relabelled 
coverdisk that you swear blind is an original.

     The version numbers for some games are a trifle odd,  and  I 
think Colin Campbell was having a go at me for this a while back. 
Despite all this, the version numbers do go up in ascending order 
with  their  rerelease,  so  it's safe  to  assume  that  version 
146657.372  is a later and consequently more wonderful  one  than 
version 19+(52cos20)þ. But it shouldn't ever get that bad.

                        COMING SOON (ISH)

          Dead or Alive Too...? - Not Dead but Sleeping
                          By Kev Davis

             Expected date of release: December 1993

     Waking up on the back of a lorry on its way to an  Icelandic 
burger factory is not the best way to start the day. Neither, for 
James Milton - proprietor of Milton's Chipporama,  is being  shot 
by an armed robber. And as for the Egyptian king, Ptedious, after 
three   thousand  years  trapped  in  a  freezing   mountainside, 
virtually anything could be better.
     Dead  Too  takes place five years after the end of  Dead  or 
Alive,  and  includes  the  option to switch  between  the  three 
undeads  at will.  Prepare to do battle  with  Weresheep,  cereal 
killers, psychopath robots, vengeful octopi, possessed electrical 
goods,   suicidal  gargoyles,   demons  on  the  housing  estate, 
cablecar-riding Nihilist monks,  interplanetary  buses,  chickens 
and  billions more things in this stunningly brilliant  (Footnote 
3) text adventure. Death has never been so much fun.


                               Antroids
                           By Harvey Reall

                Expected date of release: January 1994

     Hours  of endless fascination as you tinker about  with  the 
DNA programs of insects,  before letting them loose on the  world 
to build their colony.
     Antroids  is one of the most absorbing life  simulations  to 
date. There are limitless possibilities for the game set-up - two 
ant colonies battling against each other for survival,  a team of 
cannibal  ants  descending  on  helpless  workers,  a  two-player 
challenge to create the perfect ant,  or even just initialising a 
colony and watching it grow. The game features a dazzling variety 
of  features  to  make  your enjoyment  of  the  simulation  even 
greater, as well as sampled sound and superb graphics. If you can 
bear the sleepless nights, then buy this game.

                     Programmed by Kev Davis

          Expected date of release: Whenever we've got
                       enough stuff for it

     We  still  need a goodly number of articles and  things  for 
this.  If you fancy writing anything for this, send your stuff in 
ASCII format to either me at the usual address, or Laura at:-

     None  of  that foolish "see  how  many  swearwords,  obscene 
references  and exclamation marks we can get in  there"  attitude 
favoured by other disk mags, thanks all the same. 


               Mission Implausible II - The Metal Lurgy
                             By Kev Davis

                 Expected date of release: Early 1994

     Set  in the latter half of the 24th century,  Mish Two  sees 
the  crew  of  the Drunken Sailor caught up in  the  Metal  Lurgy 
outbreak in the city of Malton.  When the ship's android co-pilot 
takes another crewmember hostage,  it's your job to beam down and 
sort things out.
     Mish Two uses the rather swish Perpetual Reality Engine -  a 
graphic-adventure system requiring the minimum of keyboard input. 
Presented with a graphic screen,  you click on an object to bring 
up a list of relevant verbs, from which you choose one that takes 
your fancy. Couldn't be simpler.
     Note  that "Mission Implausible - Involuntary Suicide"  -  a 
rather  nice  adventure  using a  Kev-written  version  of  Simes 
Brown's  "Stone  Cold  Sober"  system,  will  probably  never  be 
released  because I got completely carried away with it  all  and 
ran out of memory. Such is life.


                   Escape from the Dungeons of Trax
                            By Robin Ball

                  Expected release date: Early 1994?

     An  extremely  impressive  game,   utilising  the  Perpetual 
Reality  Engine.  Stunning visuals and a wicked sense  of  humour 
combine to form a superb graphic adventure.  The plot for this is 
all  a bit up in the air at the moment,  but it's fairly safe  to 
assume  that  Escaping from the Dungeons of Trax  comes  into  it 
somewhere.

                            Strana Mechty
                     By Kev Davis and Simon Brown

                     Expected release date: 1994?

     This game's been undergoing severe rethinking,  and we're on 
the fourth version at the moment.  We're trying to make a comedy-
RPG  sort  of thing,  but it could end up  as  dayglo  underwater 
space-invaders  at  the  rate we're scrapping  ideas.  We  had  a 
Dungeon  Master layout a while back,  but we've ditched  that  in 
favour of an above-view approach. For the moment.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

                LIES, DAMN LIES AND RELEASE DATES

     Although   the  release  dates  stated  above  are   vaguely 
accurate,  we  can't promise anything.  We live in  an  uncertain 
world,  where nothing is for definite, and it's quite likely that 
some games will take a while to appear.

     There's  not a lot I can do about this,  as I don't like  to 
pressurise  people  into  a  quick  release  (anyone  who  bought 
Genocide on its day of release will have seen what this can  lead 
to).  However, if you desperately want to see Antroids out by the 
end  of the year,  or if Trax sounds like something you'd  really 
like  to  see - contact the  programmer  (via  myself,  probably) 
saying how much you'd like to see their product  completed.  This 
sort  of  ego-boosting does wonders for bringing  forward  actual 
release dates.
