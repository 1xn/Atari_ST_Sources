have  spent  large amounts of money  on  protection  wheels,  red 
plastic  glasses and arcane disk protection,  but we  didn't.  It 
would  have just bumped up the price of the game a quid  or  two, 
and encouraged piracy even more.

     So  there's  a chance that this is a copied version  of  the 
game, and that the programmer hasn't had any payment for it.  The 
months  of work put into it have been,  in  your  case,  ignored. 
Which  is a mite evil of you.  So perhaps you'd like to  chuck  a 
quid  or two to the programmer to make up for  things,  and  save 
your conscience,  eh?  I know we're not going to convert any die-
hard  software  pirates,  here,  but if the  programmer  of  this 
software  gets only half the royalties he's due (because  of  all 
the people who copied it instead),  there's quite a large  chance 
that he'll jack it all in. 

     Oh  -  you  won't be able to claim updates  of  this  unless 
you've  bought  it,  by  the way.  If you send  us  a  relabelled 
coverdisk with "Cynic the Bullfrog" or whatever scribbled on  it, 
we'll just keep it.  Ahahaha. Oh yes. We'll only grant updates to 
people  who  send "originals" to us.  And we'll be  doing  random 
checks on you lot - now and again,  we'll phone up a library  and 
say  "Did a Mr A N Other ever buy a copy Cynic the Bullfrog  from 
you? No?"

     Copying  this  disk is regarded as  being  vaguely  illegal, 
mind.  Whilst  we  probably won't go running to FAST if  we  find 
someone's   been  copying it (and it's possible -  we've  already 
"caught"  one  poor sap trying to claim an update with  a  forged 
original  disk),   we  will take a very dim view   of   it   all. 
Uploading  licenceware  (werl,  OCL at any rate) to any  BBSs  is 
right out, also. You have been warned. That is all.
