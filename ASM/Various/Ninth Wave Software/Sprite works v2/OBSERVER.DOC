There are already quite a few document display programs  available 
so why write a new one ?  By far the best document display program 
at the moment is Revenge written by The Hitchhiker, but I wanted a 
program which would load slightly faster, didn't have the annoying 
time  readout  when you finish,  had a proper  file  selector  and  
something  that  would work with my hard drive  (as  the  keyboard 
shortcuts do not work in Revenge with certain hard drives  !).  So 
if you want something done, do it yourself !. Also included is the 
ability to store unlimited markers within a file to move  directly 
to the marker position.

The Observer can load ICE packed files but use version 2.40 only.

This  program  was  written in GFA Basic V3  and  assembler  using 
DEVPAC 2 over a period of 4 days.

Installing Observer
-------------------

To display a document you can run the program directly and  choose 
your  text file,  or you can install it as an application  to  run 
automatically  when you select a file to display.  To install  the 
program  you must edit your DESKTOP.INF file using your  favourite 
text editor and add the following lines.

#G 03 04  [drive:\folder\]OBSERVER.PRG@ READ*.*@
#G 03 04  [drive:\folder\]OBSERVER.PRG@ *.DOC@
#G 03 04  [drive:\folder\]OBSERVER.PRG@ *.TXT@

Copy the OBSERVER.PRG to the required location such as drive B  or 
a  hard drive and if necessary put it in a folder then supply  the 
pathname  to  drive:\folder\  above.   Reboot  to  initialise  the 
desktop.inf  file then select a DOC/TXT or a README file  and  The 
Observer will automatically load and display the file. 

Using Observer
--------------

Select a file to display from the fileselector,  selecting  CANCEL 
will quit.

Use the mouse to scroll up and down the document,  use left  mouse 
button for the menu control or right mouse button to load  another 
file.

The menu has 10 options which can be selected with the mouse :

     Goto Top       Displays documents first page.
     Goto Bottom    Displays documents last page.
     Goto Line      Type line number to go to. If the line is too 
                    great it will default to the bottom.
     Search Text    Type the string to search for and the search
                    will automatically start from the top of the
                    file. You can select whether the search is
                    case sensitive or not.
     Repeat Search  Searches from the current position using the
                    original case sensitive setting.
     Set TAB Width  Type the new TAB width and the file will
                    automatically display the text with the new
                    setting. (Starting width is 8).
     Print Document Prints the entire document. There is a ten
                    second time out. There is no page formatting.
     Print Section  Allows you to select a range of lines to
                    print.
     Load Document  Displays the file selector to load another
                    file. You cannot go back to the original text.
     Infomation     Displays information about program.
     Quit           Asks for confirmation before quitting.
     Cancel         Must select to exit the menu.

You can also use keyboard shortcuts :
     
     Goto Top            T
     Goto Bottom         B
     Goto Line           G
     Search Text         S
     Repeat Search       R
     Set TAB Width       TAB
     Load Document       L
     Quit                UNDO (quick exit, no confirmation)
     Previous Marker     
     Next Marker         
     Scroll Up           
     Scroll Down         /RETURN
     Page Up             SHIFT+
     Page Down           SHIFT+/SPACE
     Invert Colours      I
     Change Hertz        *

Using Markers
-------------

You  can easily include your own markers in a document  by  making 
the  first  character  on a line a  greater  than  sign  '>'.  The 
Observer will ignore this character if it appears at the start  of 
a  line,  but  you can use the left and right arrow keys  to  move 
directly from marker to marker.

The program  works  in  all  resolutions,  but  always displays 80
columns. 

Cheers,
