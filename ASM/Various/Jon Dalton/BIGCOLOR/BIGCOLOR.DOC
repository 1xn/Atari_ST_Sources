     BIGCOLOR VERSION 1.05
      DECEMBER 1989

This program should be placed in the
AUTO folder.  It should be put there
before any other programs are put in
the AUTO folder.

BIGCOLOR.PRG is for use with MONO
monitors, and allows some LOW
RESOLUTION and most MEDIUM RESOLUTION
programs to be run on a MONO monitor.

Unlike some Colour Emulators, it
gives full screen emulation in LOW
RESOLUTION.  It produces seven
different shades (pseudo colours)
in LOW RESOLUTION, three in MEDIUM.
Unfortunately to achieve this,
it uses approximately 200 KB of
memory.  I suggest you boot up with
as few desk accessories and RAM DISKS
etc as possible.  It is compatible
with ETERNAL reset survivable RAM
DISK.  (But don't rely on it!).  I
am working on a version which uses far
less memory, but will run slower.(520
users will find a lot of programs run
out of memory. You should use no Desk
Accessories or other AUTO programs.)

When you first boot up, you are
presented with a screen which allows
you to choose the screen drawing rate.
Choose a number from one to ten, with
ten being entered by hitting 0.  The
program then installs itself which
takes approximately 15 seconds.  On
subsequent WARM boots (pressing the
reset button) it installs without
delay - if BIGCOLOR.PRG is in the
AUTO FOLDER.  In order to uninstall
the program and release the 200 KB of
memory, you have to COLD boot (switch
of the machine and switch it back on
a few seconds later).

When the starting screen appears,
you can type any letter instead of a
number from 1 to 0, and the program
is ignored and you get a normal MONO
screen.  The program remains in memory,
however.

If you press ENTER at the start up 
screen, the screen drawing rate is set 
at three and a half - the most useful
rate.  This allows the processor to
run at about 80% of normal speed. If
you enter 0, the machine slows to a 
crawl but the drawing is very smooth.
If you enter 1, the movements are very
jerky, but the speed of the processor 
is hardly reduced. Numbers between 3
to 6 are the most useful, depending on 
preference.  Check it out with QUICK
INDEX.

To change from LOW RESOLUTION to MEDIUM
RESOLUTION use SELECT PREFERENCE from
the GEM DESKTOP. Some programs that
access the hardware directly to
change between resolutions, cause the
screen to get offset.  If it remains
offset when you return to the desktop
swap resolution by using SELECT
PREFERENCE or reboot by pressing
reset. I hope to fix that bug one 
day, not many programs are affected.

When you first boot up, the
resolution (Low or Medium)
depends on the disk desktop info
file. (Use SAVE DESKTOP after you
have set your prefered resolution)

Once you have been presented with
the starting message, you can
change disks before entering a 
number or letter.  Other programs
in the AUTO FOLDER will not run,
if the Disk is changed. 

This is the first version of BIGCOLOR
and there may be some other bugs,
please let me know.  It may also clash
with some other programs.  Not many 
commercial games run, but quite a lot
of PD ones do. (Try before you buy!)

This is SHAREWARE, so if you find it
useful, a donation for registration
would be appreciated.
  
For œ10/$20/30DM you get registration
and the source code plus the latest 
update and information. (Including
the version I am writing that uses
less memory for use on 520 STs) I am
also hoping to improve mouse handling,
improve colour emulation and maybe 
improve speed.

I have tested it on my Mega ST1, and
it works with and without blitter. (I
have written a fast Blitter (Medium
only) version which is available if
anyone is interested).  As this program
uses no ROM calls, it should work on
any ST, maybe even disk based - 
subject to memory.
