                                 By Iain McLeod

     This code will work on a  FALCON  and  should  run  on an ST with some
     small changes as written in the actual source files.

     A runnable version of the packer (PACKER.TTP) is also included - enter
     (or drag) the source file  and  an  output  file INPUTNAME.BLK will be
     created after entering the X&Y resolution of the picure.

     Its use is primarily for FALCON owners though since it is designed for
     16 True Colour packing but  it  shouldn't  need that much changing for
     any other colour sets.

     I am using it for my  introduction  screen  on  a game I'm writing and
     receive a compression of 17%. The good thing is that you DON'T NEED TO
     UNPACK AGAIN AND CAN  BLIT  (STRAIGHT)  TO  SCREEN.  This  was my main
     objective and can blit faster than  normal - although I'm sure someone
     can do it faster still and if  so please tell me. Powerful effects can
     also be applied easily & fast.
