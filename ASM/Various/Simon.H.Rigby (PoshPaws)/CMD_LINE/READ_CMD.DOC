SUB-ROUTINE NAME     Read_cmdlin
BRIEF DESCRIPTION    Get command line in Null terminated form
FILENAME             READ_CMD
OTHER RESOURCES      Requires that the Basepage address be saved at

LANGUAGE             Assembler (Devpac)
AUTHOR               Simon.H.Rigby - aka PoshPaws - aka Si(gh)
ENTRY PARAMETERS     A0 = Basepage Address
MACRO PARAMETERS     Pass Basepage_address ('Basepage' in Macro_v1)
EXIT PARAMETERS      D0 = 0 if successful, -1 if not
                     A0 = Command Line Address
                     D1 = Command Line Length (not including 0 at end)

DETAILS -
 Takes the Basepage Address and adds $80 to it to get the Command Line
 Address (P_cmdlin). Takes first byte (string length) and checks to see
 if it is zero. Set d0 to -1 if zero and return.
 If not zero, set d1 to length and a0 to point to string.
 Null terminate string.
 Destroys previous contents of d0-d1/a0.

Example - Library
          move.l     Basepage,a0     ;Basepage contains address of Basepage
          bsr        Read_cmdlin
          tst.b      d0              ;0 if ok
          blt        fail
          move.l     a0,cmdlin_addr  ;storage for command line address
          ...
          ...
fail                 Prog_exit               ;no command line - so exit
