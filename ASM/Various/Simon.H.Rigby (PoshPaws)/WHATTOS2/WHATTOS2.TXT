Having seen the methods used by The Space Cowboy's code, I thought
it might be nice to 'legalise' some of the more 'risky' coding.
I hope that this will be looked at as a possible way of improving each
other's code. I would, in return, be pleased to receive any comments on
any of my code that you feel could be improved.

Please note that all TT TOS is version 3, all Falcon TOS is version 4.
Anything less is ST/STE.
