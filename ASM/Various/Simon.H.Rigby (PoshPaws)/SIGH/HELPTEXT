     =========================
     There was a bug in the last  version  of  this utility on the disk! If
     you had a command line  starting  on  an  odd address then the program
     would give an address error. This  has  been corrected and is  now re-
     submitted. All library files are included  but the macro files are not
     as it uses the macros given away previously on ICTARI>

     Macros_2 (ICTARI issue 9)
     =========================
     The macros included in this folder havs been updated from the previous
     version. Please copy this over  the  old  files. Unchanged macros have
     not been included.

     Mouse_3 (ICTARI issue 9)
     ========================
     I do seem to be  suffering  from  address  errors on programs I'd seen
     running perfectly, but that is one  of  the problems with testing code
     on a Falcon; it will allow words  on  an odd address. Mouse 3 suffered
     from an address error on  filling  the  strings with spaces. Also, The
     mouse only seems to update with  Line  A  while  the program is a .PRG
     (i.e. under Gem) and not otherwise!  Anyway, the modified files are in
     the folder.

     Please note that programs are  either  written  on  a Falcon under TOS
     4.02 or on an ST under TOS 1.08  but  only one or the other. Sooner or
     later it gets run on the other and any faults found are corrected.
