SUB-ROUTINE NAME        Load_file
BRIEF DESCRIPTION       Load a file into memory allocated by subroutine
FILENAME                LOADFILE.S
OTHER RESOURCES         Must Mfree file_address before program exit
LANGUAGE                Assembler (Devpac)
AUTHOR                  Simon.H.Rigby - aka PoshPaws - aka Si(gh)

ENTRY PARAMETERS        A0 = Pointer to full path & filename
MACRO PARAMETERS        NOT IMPLEMENTED IN MACRO FORM

EXIT PARAMETERS         D0 = 0 if sucessful or -ve GEMDOS Error Code
                        A0 = Start Address of file in memory
                        D1 = Length of File

DETAILS -

Uses standard GEMDOS calls to Fopen the file, Malloc all available space,
Fread the file into the  memory  block,  Fclose  the file and Mshrink the
memory block to the required size.

Any errors on  any  Gemdos  call  will  terminate  the  routine  with the
appropriate error code in d0. Any  Malloc'ed  memory will be freed before
exit of a failed  routine.  Extensive  use  is  made  of  the  stack as a
temporary storage area but any  stack  size  greater  than 256 bytes will
suffice.

Example - library

                move.l  #filename,a0
                bsr     Load_file    ;move mouse pointer
                tst.l   d0
                blt     Gemdos_Fail
                move.l  a0,file_addr
                move.l  d1,file_len
                ...
                ...
                Mfree   file_addr
                ...
                ...
