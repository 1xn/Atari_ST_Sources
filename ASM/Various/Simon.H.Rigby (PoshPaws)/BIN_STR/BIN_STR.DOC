SUB-ROUTINE NAME        Bin_str
BRIEF DESCRIPTION       Convert Number in d0.l to Binary String
FILENAME                BIN_STR.S
OTHER RESOURCES         None
LANGUAGE                Assembler (Devpac)
AUTHOR                  Simon.H.Rigby - aka PoshPaws - aka Si(gh)

ENTRY PARAMETERS        A0   = Address to put string
                        D0.L = Value to Convert
                        D1   = How many bits to Convert (1-32)

EXIT PARAMETERS         A0   = Address of first byte after string

DETAILS -

Takes the contents of d0.l and converts  it  into a string of 0's and 1's
at the address given in a0. It will only Convert the number of bits asked
for in d1 (1-32). It does not  terminate  the  string with a Null (0), in
case you want to add to the string. Make sure your string has enough room
for the number of bits you are converting and the Null. Destroys previous
contents of d0-d1/a0.

                move.l  #8,d1           ;eight bits only
