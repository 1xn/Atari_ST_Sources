    This was made about 6-7 years ago to show how LineA Putpix works
for a local ST Club assembler class. Talk about taking a sledge hammer
to crack a nut!

    It works by defining two circles - pixel by pixel. All the pixels
are given the same initial x & y velocities and thus the ball is launched.
At a pre-determined height the pixels are each given random velocities and
hence the ball explodes. Symmetry is used to give two balls for better
effect.

    Gravity is simulated by using negative acceleration s=Ut-0.5(gt^2).
where s is height, U is vertical velocity, t is time and g is gravity value
Also U'=U-gt

    Hope this makes sense, I haven't really looked at the code and it WAS
an awful long time ago!
