       **THE BOOTSECTOR COMPANION IS A SHAREWARE PROGRAM**


WHAT IS SHAREWARE
=================
         Shareware  means that  this program  can  be  distributed
         freely,  but  if you use it  more than once you are asked
         to make a contribution to the author.

         This program should only be distributed with the
         following files:-

                    BOOTCOMP.PRG - The main program
                    BOOTCOMP.DAT - The data files
                    BOOTCOMP.SC1 -       ""
                    BOOTCOMP.SC2 -       ""
                    BOOTCOMP.DOC - Documentation
                    VIRINFO.DOC  - Virus information
                    EXAMPLE.S    - Example 68000 source
                    EXAMPLE.BIN  - Assembled 68000 source

         The  address  to send contributions to is at the  end  of 
         this document.

         If you make a contribution of œ5 or more you will be sent 
         an updated version of TBC when it is released  (Hopefully 
         some time  in July 93) + a  printed  manual (And  maybe a
         copy of a program I am working on right now!).


BASIC INFO
==========

To Load: Double  Click  on  'BOOTCOMP.PRG' inside  the  'BOOTCOMP' 
         folder.

 To Use: Once TBC has  loaded you will be presented with  a  title 
         screen.

         At this  point TBC checks  it's  self  integrity  i.e. it
         checks itself to  see if it  has been  infected by a link
         virus.

         TBC also checks to see if a  known virus is in memory, if 
         there is the screen  will flash red  and you will be told
         the name of the  virus, there  will  then be  a  wait  of
         approx. 20  seconds before  the virus is  deactivated and
         the computer is reset. TBC should now be loaded again.

         If there isn't  a known virus in memory there will  be  a
         wait of approx. 10-15  seconds  while the  computer reads
         data.  When the data has been read in a copyright message
         will be displayed,  press  any key or a mouse  button  to
         continue.

         You will now be presented with the TBC selection  screen. 
         Along  the top of the   screen are five  pull-down menus. 
         These  are  'Desk',   'Disk',   'Virus',   'Repair'   and 
         'Options'.  Each  of  these  pull-down  menus  contain  a 
         variety  of functions.  Select a function in exactly  the 
         same  way that you would select a function from  the  GEM 
         desktop.


MENUS
=====

   Desk: 'About  Bootsector  Companion' - Tells  you  the  version 
            number  of TBC and also gives the bootsector and virus 
            recognition statistics and the repair statistics.

            Any accessories  installed  at bootup will  also be in
            this menu.


   Disk: 'Install  Bootsector'  - Takes  a   bootsector  file  and 
            writes it to  the bootsector  of a disk.  First select
            the bootsector file you  want to install, then  choose
            the drive containing  the disk you want the bootsector
            to be installed on.

            ******************************************************

         'Store  Bootsector' - Takes a bootsector off a  disk  and 
            stores it as a file. First select the drive containing 
            the disk with the bootsector on, then enter a filename 
            using the fileselector.

         'Install  Bootcode'  - Takes a stored bootcode  file  and 
            installs  the bootcode onto the bootsector of  a  disk 
            (This  Option is  only  of real  use to  programmers). 
            First select the bootcode file using the fileselector, 
            next  enter the bootcode offset  (The  offset  is  the 
            value that is placed in byte 2 of the bootsector). The 
            offset  can be in the range 0/28-126.  Now select  the 
            drive  containing  the  disk  you  want  the  bootcode 
            installed on.

         'Store Bootcode' - Examines the bootsector of a disk  and 
            stores  the bootcode contained on it (This  option  is 
            only of real  use to programmers).  First  select  the 
            drive containing the disk with the bootcode  on,  then 
            enter a filename using the fileselector.
            ******************************************************
            ** NOTE: This Option Takes The Bootcode Offset (If  **
            **       There Is One?) From The First Two Bytes Of **
            **       The Bootsector. If There Is No Offset The  **
            **       Whole Bootsector Will Be Saved.            **
            ******************************************************

         'Display  Bootsector'  -  Displays   the  contents  of  a 
            bootsector. First select where you want to display the 
            bootsector from,  select either 'Disk' or  'File'.  If 
            you  selected 'Disk' you now have to select the  drive 
            containing  the disk with the bootsector you  want  to 
            display. If you selected 'File' you now have to select 
            a  bootsector file  using the  fileselector.  After  a 
            small  wait  the contents of the  bootsector  will  be 
            displayed  in  hexadecimal (Base 16)  format.  At  the 
            bottom of the screen you will see four options  H=Hex, 
            A=ASCII, P=Print and Space=Exit. Press 'A' to view the 
            contents  of the bootsector in ASCII format or if  you 
            would  like a permanent record of the contents of  the 
            bootsector  press 'P' to print.  To leave this  screen 
            press 'Space'.

         'Set Default Drive' - Does exactly as it says,  sets  the 
            default drive.  Simply select the drive letter for the 
            drive you want to be the default drive.

         'Disk  Information' - Displays lots of information  about 
            the  Bios  Parameter Block(BPB),  Executability  of  a 
            disk, and various other information. Simply select the 
            drive you want information about.

  Virus: 'Check Bootsector' - Checks a  bootsector for a  known ST
            or PC virus or gives information on  other  recognised 
            bootsectors.  First  select the drive  containing  the 
            disk  you want to check.  If a recognised virus is  on  
            the  disk  the screen will flash red and you  will  be 
            told  the  name of the virus.  You will  be  given  an 
            option  to kill the virus.  If you kill the virus  the 
            disk  will  be immunised against infection  from  some 
            (But NOT ALL!) viruses.  If a recognised bootsector is 
            on  the disk checked the computer will tell  you  what 
            the checked disk is.  If an unrecognised bootsector is 
            on the disk checked the screen will flash  green,  the 
            computer will then proceed  to do a virus  probability 
            test.  Based on the results of this test you should be 
            able  to  tell  if the unrecognised  bootsector  is  a 
            virus.

         'Check File' - Checks a file for either ST or PC link
            viruses. Using the fileselector select an executable
            file that you want to check. If there is a known ST or
            PC link virus present the screen will flash red and
            you will be given the name of the virus. If the virus
            is a PC virus you must use a suitable PC virus killer
            to kill the virus. If the virus is an ST virus you
            will be given an option to kill the virus.

         'Current  Status'  - Gives information  on No.  of  disks
            checked,  No.  of viruses found, No. of viruses killed
            etc.


 Repair: 'Repair  Bootsector' - Allows  you to repair  bootsectors 
            that have been damaged e.g.  by Viruses,  by  Magnetic 
            Corruption  or by  You. On  this screen you will see a 
            list of bootsectors that can be repaired. Controls for 
            this screen are the Up/Down arrow keys to move to  the 
            Previous/Next item, Shift + Up/Down arrow keys to move 
            Backwards/Forwards a page,  Enter to select an item or 
            Space to exit the screen. Once an item is selected you 
            must select the drive that contains the disk with  the 
            damaged  bootsector. This once damaged bootsector will 
            now work again.

Options: '60Hz/50Hz  Sync Rate' - Toggles  the sync  rate  between 
            60Hz and 50Hz.

         'Inverse Screen' - Does exactly as it says. Changes Black 
            to White and vice versa.

         'System  Info' - Gives information  on the current system 
            setup.  Also  informs  you if there is a  reset  proof 
            program in memory.

         'Quit  Program'  -  Quits TBC and returns to the desktop.
            Before  you actually quit you are asked a second  time 
            just in case this option was chosen by accident.

         Step 4: Enter MonST2 (Alt 'D')

         Step 5: Save code as a binary file by pressing 'S'
                 Enter filename
                 Enter Start & End Address

         Step 6: Load TBC

         Step 7: Choose Install Bootcode option

         Step 8: Select the binary file using the fileselector

         Step 9: Enter offset as 28

        Step 10: Insert blank formatted disk into a drive

        Step 11: Select the drive you placed the disk in
