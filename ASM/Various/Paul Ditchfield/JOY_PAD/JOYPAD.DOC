                               By Paul Ditchfield

     I have sent all the information I  have  on  the 15 pin ports found on
     the STE and Falcon.  Unfortunately I do not have any info specifically
     on analogue joysticks, however I  do  have  detailed info on using the
     Atari joypads (as found on  the  Jaguar).   I  have included a routine
     which reads these pads  and  reports  the  results  in  an easily used
     format, see JOYVBL.S.

     The information that follows is largely  taken from the official Atari
     documentation  (hope  they   don't   mind!)   together   with  my  own
     observations/explanations.


                             JOYSTICK/KEYPAD MATRIX


     The memory map that follows  defines  the joystick/keypad matrix.  All
     of these inputs are read  by  scanning.   You  start by writing FF9202
     with the appropriate bit set low  (all  others set high).  Then FF9200
     and FF9202 are read to see if  any  bits are low.  The buttons pressed
     are read off of the matrix.  As  an example, FFFE is written to FF9202
     (bit 0 set low) and  then  FF9200  and  FF9202  are read. Any low bits
     correspond to the  first  column  in  the  table.   Note  that  in the
     following, "ro" means when read and "wo" means when written.


     FF9200 ---- ---- ---- xxxx  ro BUTTON (Button inputs)

     bit 0           controller A            PAUSE
     bit 1           controller A            F0      F1      F2      OPTION

     bit 2           controller B            PAUSE
     bit 3           controller B            F0      F1      F2      OPTION


     FF9202 ---- ---- xxxx xxxx  wo JOY (Joystick outputs)

     bit 0           controller A ___________X
     bit 1           controller A ___________________X
     bit 2           controller A ___________________________X
     bit 3           controller A ___________________________________X

     bit 4           controller B ___________X
     bit 5           controller B ___________________X
     bit 6           controller B ___________________________X
     bit 7           controller B ____________________________________X


     FF9202 xxxx xxxx ---- ---- ro JOY (Joystick inputs)

     bit 8           controller A            U       *       0        #
     bit 9           controller A            D       7       8        9
     bit 10          controller A            L       4       5        6
     bit 11          controller A            R       1       2        3

     bit 12          controller B            U       *       0        #
     bit 13          controller B            D       7       8        9
     bit 14          controller B            L       4       5        6
     bit 15          controller B            R       1       2        3

     As you can see each  controller  only  has  6  bits in which to report
     events from a  total  of  21  inputs  (four  directions  plus  all the
     buttons).  What you have to  do  then,  is  tell the machine which six
     buttons you want to look at.   This  is  done as explained, by setting
     the appropriate bit in FF9202  to  0.   For  instance if you move FFFB
     into FF9202 (i.e. set bit 2 to 0)  then you are telling the machine to
     report the status of F2,0,8,5,2 on  controller A.  The results will be
     contained in bit 1 of FF9200 (F2) and bits 0-3 of FF9202 (0,8,5,2).

     Note that as soon as  these  registers  are  read they are immediately
     reset to their default values,  so  you  should 'read' them by copying
     them into a data register or  a  buffer  where they can be examined at
     leisure.

     Also remember that events are reported by  bits being cleared to 0 not
     by being set to 1.



                               OTHER CONTROLLERS


     Here are the other  registers  associated  with  the analogue ports, I
     know next to nothing about these or the controllers used with them.

     PADDLES

     FF9210          ---- ---- xxxx xxxx     (X Paddle A)
     FF9212          ---- ---- xxxx xxxx     (Y Paddle A)
     FF9214          ---- ---- xxxx xxxx     (X Paddle B)
     FF9216          ---- ---- xxxx xxxx     (Y Paddle B)

     One pair of paddles can  be  plugged  into  joystick  0 (paddle 0).  A
     second set can be plugged  into  joystick  1  (paddle 1).  The current
     position of each of the four  paddles  is reported at these locations.
     The fire buttons are the  same  as  for  the respective joystick.  The
     triggers for the paddles are read as bits one and two of FF9202.


     LIGHT GUN/PEN

     FF9220          ---- --xx xxxx xxxx     (X position)
     FF9222          ---- --xx xxxx xxxx     (Y position)

     A light gun or  pen  can  be  plugged  into  joystick  0.  The current
     position that the gun  or  pen  is  pointing  to  is reported by these
     registers.
