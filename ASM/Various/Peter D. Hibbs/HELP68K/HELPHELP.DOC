                              HELP 68000 PROGRAM
                              ==================

    The HELP68.ACC accessory program which  was  sent  in  by a member is a
    very useful aid to 68000 CPU  programmers,  it is a program which gives
    information on the 68K instruction set and can be called up from within
    any program that gives access to  desk  accessories. It would be mainly
    used when writing programs  using  the  Devpac  assembler (or any other
    assembler).

    Copy the files HELP68.ACC and HELP68.RSC  to the root directory of your
    boot drive to try it out. Unfortunately  it does not work on my system,
    it bombs out when I click  on  an  information  box. The source code is
    also included on the  disk  (written  in  French)  so  it would be very
    helpful to the group if someone could try and debug the program and get
    it working. We will publish the first working version we receive.
