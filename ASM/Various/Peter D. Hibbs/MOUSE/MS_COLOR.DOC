                     =====================================

                                 By Peter Hibbs

     Elsewhere on this disk is a routine  to  change the shape of the mouse
     cursor (MS_SHAPE). It is also  possible  to  change the colours of the
     mouse in medium or low resolution and this note describes the method.

     Firstly a description  of  how  the  mouse  cursor  data  is stored in
     memory. The mouse cursor can have  a  maximum size of 16x16 pixels and
     each mouse shape consists of a small block of data 74 bytes long which
     holds the hot-spot offset co-ordinates, the colour information and the
     shape information. The table below shows the layout :-

     Function                Values          Size

     Hotspot x offset        0-15            1 word
     Hotspot y offset        0-15            1 word
     Number of planes        1               1 word
     Mask colour             0-15            1 word
     Form colour             0-15            1 word
     Mask data               $00-$ff         32 bytes
     Form data               $00-$ff         32 bytes

     The first two values define the  hotspot  position relative to the top
     left pixel. The number of planes  is  always  set to 1 (on ST's) since
     only two colours can be used  for  a  mouse cursor. The mask colour is
     normally set to 0 and defines the  colour of the outline of the mouse.
     The form colour is normally set  to  1  and defines the form (or fill)
     colour. The next 32 bytes define  the  mask shape followed by the form
     shape data which also requires 32 bytes.

     Normally the mouse  appears  in  the  colours  black  and  white (i.e.
     colours 0 and 1 using the GEM  palette)  but, by changing the mask and
     form colour values in the table, any  other  colours can be used. At a
     point in the program  after  the  mouse  data  has  been loaded in and
     before the mouse shape is changed the colours should be changed to the
     new values required. Note  that  since  this  is  a  GEM function, the
     colour codes  will  be  the  GEM  palette  values,  see  below  for  a
     translation table of colour index to  GEM index codes. For example, to
     set the mask and form colours to  colours  11 and 7 (colour indexes 10
     and 5) the following code could be used :-

                     move            #11,mouse_data+6        ;set mask
                     move            #7,mouse_data+8         ;set form
                     move            #8,d0                   ;show mouse
                     bsr             ms_shape
                     ..
