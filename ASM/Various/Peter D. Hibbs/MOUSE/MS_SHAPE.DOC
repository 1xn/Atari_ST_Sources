DETAILS -

The GEM system has eight different  mouse  shapes  that  can be used for the
cursor, i.e. arrow, text cursor, bee,  finger, hand, thin cross, thick cross
and outline cross. Any of these  shapes  can be selected with the graf_mouse
GEM call and in addition a  user  defined  shape  can be used by setting the
ident code to 255 and providing  the  address  of a data block which defines
the mouse shape and mask data.

On the cover disk of ST Format issue  59 (June 94) there is a program called
Mouse_Ka_Mania which allows the user  to  change  any  of the above standard
mouse shapes into a new one selected  by  the  user. On the disk there are a
large number of  different  mouse  shapes  which  can  be  used  in existing
programs.

In some programs it can be very  useful  to have a different mouse shape for
some operations, for example the mouse  could  change  to a pair of scissors
for a cutting function or to a pencil for a drawing function and so on. This
gives much better feedback to the  user  about  the current operation of the
program and makes it more  'user  friendly'.  This  routine allows any mouse
shape (in addition to the eight standard ones) to be used in a program.

First copy the mouse shapes  required  to  your  working disk (only the non-
animated ones) and note the  filenames  (and  pathname  if relevant). In the
program source file  define  a  label  called  'mouse_data'  and include the
required mouse data files with  the  'incbin'  pseudo-op code. To change the
mouse shape in the program load register d0 with the ident code and call the
'ms_shape' sub-routine. The standard shapes have the ident codes 0-7 (in the
order mentioned above)  and  the  user  defined  shapes  will  be numbered 8
onwards in the order that they  are  included  in the buffer. For example to
select the 'BELL' shape use the code below :-

                move            #9,d0           select the 'bell' shape
                bsr             ms_shape        and change to it
                ..

mouse_data      incbin          F:\MOUSE_KA\MICE\1FRAME\BRUSH.DAT    (8)
                incbin          F:\MOUSE_KA\MICE\1FRAME\BELL.DAT     (9)
                incbin          F:\MOUSE_KA\MICE\1FRAME\FLOPPY.DAT   (10)
                incbin          F:\MOUSE_KA\MICE\1FRAME\JACKNIFE.DAT (11)
                ..

Set up the pathname for your  disk  setup.  The program must ensure that the
ident code does not exceed the number of  user defined mice used (11 in this
example) or the program may crash.  This  code  will work in any resolution.
