                               ==================
                                 by Peter Hibbs

     INTRODUCTION.
     -------------

     This program can be used to compile a block of sound samples which can
     then be loaded into a user program  which  can play them back one at a
     time as required. The sound samples  imported  into the data file must
     be pure samples (i.e. no headers) and  in 8 bit signed format. Usually
     .SAM files are  used  although  other  formats  may  be  OK. The sound
     samples can be played  back  using  routines  provided (see PLAY_SND.S
     file) using the  PSG  chip.  This  program  works  in  High and Medium
     resolution only.

     PROGRAM OPERATION
     -----------------

     The operation of the program is  fairly self-explanatory but here is a
     brief description of each command.

                                   FILE menu
                                   ---------
     New file (ALT N)
     ----------------
     Clears any existing sound sample file in memory.

     Load sound file (ALT L)
     -----------------------
     Loads a sound sample block (XXXXXXXX.SSB)  file into memory. Note that
     the program grabs ALL the available  memory  except for 80Kb to ensure
     that there is enough room for the sound  file. If you only have half a
     meg of RAM, remove as many  auto programs and accessories as possible.
     Also if the file loaded is not  a  valid .SSB file an error message is
     displayed. The sound samples in the file are displayed in the window.

     Save sound file (ALT S)
     -----------------------
     Saves  the  current  file  to   disk.   The  extension  code  .SSB  is
     automatically appended to the filename.

     Delete file (ALT D)
     -------------------
     Deletes a sound sample block file on disk.

     Quit (ALT Q)
     ------------
     Quits program. If the current file  has  been  changed but not saved a
     warning message is displayed.

                                   EDIT Menu
                                   ---------
     Import sample (ALT I)
     ---------------------
     Import a sound sample into the  data  file.  Any type of file could be
     imported although .SAM sound samples would be the most likely to work.
     The file is added to the  end  of  the  current data block. Since .SAM
     samples do not have any indication of the frequency that the sound was
     sampled at, the program automatically  sets  it  to 15000Hz since this
     seems to be the most common  one  used. If this frequency is incorrect
     it can be changed (see  below).  The  file  is displayed in the screen
     window with the ident number,  the  file  size,  the frequency and the
     filename. Note that if the file length  is an odd number of bytes, the
     last byte is removed to force it to an even number of bytes.

     Delete sample (ALT Z)
     ---------------------
     Deletes a sound sample from the file. First display the file to delete
     in the window (by using the  scroll  bars if necessary) and then click
     on the file once with the left  mouse button to highlight it. Clicking
     on 'Delete file' or pressing ALT Z  will delete the file from the data
     block. Note that there is no  warning  on  this  command and that if a
     file is highlighted, even though it is  not visible on screen, it will
     still be deleted.  If  a  file  is  not  highlighted,  the  command is
     ignored.

     Edit frequency (ALT F)
     ----------------------
     To change  the  default  frequency  stored  in  the  data  file, first
     highlight the sample file to be  changed  (by clicking on it once) and
     then click on 'Set frequency' or press ALT F. A dialog box will appear
     with the file ident  number  and  filename.  The  current frequency is
     shown together with the text cursor.  Press  ESCAPE to erase the value
     and enter a new value (between 0Hz and 30000Hz) and click OK. The main
     window is re-displayed with the new value.

     Play sample (ALT P) (Double click)
     ----------------------------------
     To test a sound sample either double  click on the file entry with the
     left mouse or first highlight it  and  click  on 'Play sample' or just
     press ALT P.

     Other keyboard controls
     -----------------------
     The UP and DOWN arrow keys move the  window scroll bars up or down one
     step and SHIFT UP and SHIFT DOWN keys move the scroll bars 20 files at
     a time. The window is not movable  although the normal EXIT box can be
     used to exit the program.


     .SSB FILE FORMAT
     ----------------

     The format of a .SSB file is as follows :-

     Size    No      Data      Function
     ----    --      ----      --------
     LONG    1       $273EA4   File ident code (at start of file only)

     LONG    1       nnnn      Length of file (even number)
     WORD    1       nnnn      Sample frequency
     BYTE    14      'nnn.nnn' Sample filename
     BYTE    Length  nn        Sound data (nnnn bytes set by length above)

     Next sample in same format as first sample (20+nnnn bytes)

     Next sample in same format as first sample, etc (20+nnnn bytes)

     LONG    1       $FFFFFFFF End of file marker

     File description.
     -----------------
     The first four bytes of a  .SSB  file consist of a longword identifier
     value. The sample files then follow the identifier, each file consists
     of a 20 byte header followed by the sound data itself. As shown above,
     the header stores the length  (in  bytes)  of  the  sound data but not
     including the header data, the sample  frequency and the filename. The
     frequency value is used by the  sample  play  routines so this must be
     correct. The filename information is ignored  by the play routines, it
     is only there for reference.

     A value of $FFFFFFFF (-1) is added to  the end of the complete file to
     signal the end of the data  file  (no  sound sample should have a file
     length of that value).

     To locate a particular  sample  data  block  the  program should set a
     pointer to the start of the file  plus 4 (to skip the identifier code)
     and then add  the  data  at  that  address  (the  file  length) to the
     pointer. Then add 20 bytes to  skip  the  header bytes which will then
     set the pointer to the  start  of  the  next sample block. Repeat this
     until the required file has been reached.

     For example, to locate file number 3 (i.e. fourth file) :-

              move     #3,d0         initialise count
              lea      snd_data+4,a0 locate data
     loop     dbra     d0,exit       dec counter & branch if -1
              add.l    (a0),a0       skip data
              add      #20,a0        skip header
              bra      loop          loop & check next

     exit     ..             a0 points at header of sample 3


     snd_data incbin   sounds.ssb    include sound data file here

     Remember that samples start numbering from 0.

     FEEDBACK
     --------
     Any comments about this  program  should  be  sent  to  Peter Hibbs at
     ICTARI. The source code for this  program  is  available if any member
     would like to add their own modifications.  Send a disk and postage to
     ICTARI if this is required.

     FUTURE OPTIONS
     --------------
     One possible option would  be  to  add  some  code  to  the sound play
     routine so that if the DMA  chip  is  present the sound sample will be
     played through the DMA system. This will  have to wait until I can get
     access to an STE, unless anyone else would like to modify the code.
