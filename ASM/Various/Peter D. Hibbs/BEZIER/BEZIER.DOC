DETAILS -

This routine will draw a bezier curve line on a GEM screen. To use it first
initialise GEM/AES in the normal way as  the routine uses the 'v_pline' GEM
function to draw the lines. Define  an  eight word array called 'bez_in' in
RAM to hold  the  screen  co-ordinates.  To  draw  a  line,  first load the
required screen co-ordinate values into the array as follows :-

        bez_in+0        x co-ord of start of line.
        bez_in+2        y co-ord of start of line.
        bez_in+4        x co-ord of 1st control point.
        bez_in+6        y co-ord of 1st control point.
        bez_in+8        x co-ord of 2nd control point.
        bez_in+10       y co-ord of 2nd control point.
        bez_in+12       x co-ord of end of line.
        bez_in+14       y co-ord of end of line.

Then call the 'draw_bezier' sub-routine to draw the line on screen, i.e.

        v_hide_c                        ;hide mouse cursor
        bsr             draw_bezier     ;draw line
        v_show_c        #1              ;show mouse cursor

The BEZ_TAB.DAT file must also be included  as  a binary file as this table
holds the bezier constants required  by  the  bezier routines. The routines
themselves could be copied into the  program  source code file but as there
is quite a lot of code it is probably better to 'include' them as a library
file. The library file also includes the SIF maths routines written by John
Logan to calculate the co-ordinates which could  be used by the program, if
required. See ICTARI issue 14 for  further details. A typical program could
look like :-


        start           initialise GEM/AES

                        initialise program, etc

                        move    #50,bez_in+0    ;x co-ord of start
                        move    #50,bez_in+2    ;y co-ord of start
                        move    #170,bez_in+4   ;x co-ord of 1st ctrl
                        move    #200,bez_in+6   ;y co-ord of 1st cntrl
                        move    #80,bez_in+8    ;x co-ord of 2nd cntrl
                        move    #120,bez_in+10  ;y co-ord of 2nd cntrl
                        move    #300,bez_in+12  ;x co-ord of end
                        move    #270,bez_in+14  ;y co-ord of end
                        v_hide_c                ;hide mouse cursor
                        bsr             draw_bezier     ;draw line
                        v_show_c        #1      ;show mouse cursor
                        ..

                        include         BEZ_LIB.S       ;include bezier lib
                        ..
