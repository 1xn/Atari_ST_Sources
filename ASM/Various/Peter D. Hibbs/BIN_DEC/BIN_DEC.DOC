ENTRY PARAMETERS        d0.L holds value to be converted
                        a0 holds address of output buffer

EXIT PARAMETERS         Decimal number stored in buffer, NUL terminated
                        a0=address of NUL character

DETAILS.

The binary value in d0.l is converted to the equivalent decimal value and
stored as a string of ASCII  characters  in  the output buffer defined by
the address register a0.  Leading  zeroes  are  suppressed, i.e. 50123 is
stored as 50123 and not 0000050123. If the value of d0.L is zero a single
'0' is stored. The decimal number is terminated with a NUL (00) code. The
output buffer must be large enough to  hold the number plus the NUL code,
12 bytes should be sufficient.

On exit no registers  are  changed  except  a0  which  points  at the NUL
character (the least significant digit  plus  1). This allows the calling
program to append more characters, if required. A typical example code is
shown below :-

                move.l          #12345678,d0    load d0.l
                lea             output_buff,a0  set buffer pointer
                bsr             bin_dec         convert number to ASCII
                ..


output_buff     ds.b            12              buffer holds number


Note that the number range will be  from 0 to 8,589,934,591 (32 bits) and
is an unsigned value, i.e. positive value only.

The decimal number look up table at  label 'dec_table' is the same as the
one used in the dec_bin routine so  that if both routines are included in
the users program, one of the tables should be deleted.
