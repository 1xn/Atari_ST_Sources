DETAILS -

This routine is used to  display  a  Calamus  font  character that has been
formatted in memory by the 'make_chr_set'  sub-routine. Registers d0 and d1
should first be set to the  required  x  and y  co-ordinates, the reference
point for the character cell is the top left corner of the image. Note that
these values can be negative values if the reference co-ordinate is off the
screen area, the routine will just show  the area of the character which is
visible on screen. If the clipping rectangle is active only the area within
the rectangle will be displayed

Copy the ASCII code of the character to be displayed into register d2. This
should be in the  range  $20-$FF,  any  value  outside  this  range will be
ignored and will  return  an  error  code.  If  the  character  is  not one
available in the font, it will also  be ignored and an error returned. Note
that no registers are changed by this routine.

Set register a0 to the  start  of  the  character address table, 'ca_table'
which holds the start address of each character bit image. Remember that if
more than one font is being used,  there  will be a 'ca_table' for each one
which could be labelled 'ca1_table', 'ca2_table', etc.

Since the  routine  uses  the  'vrt_cpyfm'  VDI  function,  the  source and
destination Memory Form Definition Blocks  (mfdb)  must  also be defined in
RAM as two 20 word stores labelled 'srce_mfdb' and 'dest_mfdb'.

Turn off the mouse cursor, if it is visible and call the routine to display
the character.

On return from the routine the CPU Z flag is cleared (bne) if there were no
errors and not if there were. The  user program should test this flag after
each call to confirm that the image was displayed.

The draw mode and  the  display  colours  can  also  be  changed within the
routine, if required. See the CFN_CODE.DOC  file for further information on
this.
