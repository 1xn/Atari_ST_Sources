ENTRY PARAMETERS        a0=start address of bit image buffer
                        a1=start address of cleared temporary image buffer

EXIT PARAMETERS         Temporary buffer holds outline character image

DETAILS -

This routine  is  used  to  make  an  outline  image  of  an  existing font
character. First generate the image of  a  character  in a buffer using the
'make_image' sub-routine together with the eight byte header information.

Set the a0 register to the start of  the  buffer and set register a1 to the
start address of a temporary buffer of the same size as the character image
buffer. The temporary buffer must first  be  cleared to all zeros. When the
routine is called an outline copy  of  the  character will be formed in the
temporary buffer. Note that the  header  information  is also copied to the
temporary buffer so that the  image  can  be displayed with the 'blit_char'
sub-routine  as  normal  (see   the   'blit_char'   data   sheet  for  more
information).

Some typical code could be as follows :-

                lea     font_buffer,a0          locate font data
                move    #50,font_size           divide factor=50
                bsr     calc_top                set up size variables

                move    #'A'-32,d7              use letter A
                move.l  #img_buffer,chr_addr    locate image buffer
                bsr     make_image              generate image in buffer

                lea     img_buffer,a0           locate image data
                lea     temp_buffer,a1          locate temporary buffer
                bsr     outline                 make outline image

                move    #50,d0                  set x co-ord
                move    #50,d1                  set y co-ord
                lea     temp_buffer,a0          locate outline image
                bsr     blit_char               display outline image
