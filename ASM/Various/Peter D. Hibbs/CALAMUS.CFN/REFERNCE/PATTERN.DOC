ENTRY PARAMETERS        a0=start address of bit image buffer
                        a1=start address of pattern data

EXIT PARAMETERS         Bit image buffer holds modified character image

DETAILS -

This routine is used to modify  an  existing  character with a bit pattern.
First generate the image of a character  in a buffer using the 'make_image'
sub-routine together with the eight byte header information.

Set the a0 register to the start of  the buffer and also set register a1 to
the start of the bit pattern  data.  This  a  buffer consisting of 16 words
which hold the required  pattern  information.  For  example, to change the
character image to a grey scale  (in  monochrome) the pattern data would be
as follows :-

pattern_data    dc.w    %0101010101010101
                dc.w    %1010101010101010
                dc.w    %0101010101010101
                dc.w    %1010101010101010
                dc.w    %0101010101010101
                dc.w    %1010101010101010
                dc.w    %0101010101010101
                dc.w    %1010101010101010
                dc.w    %0101010101010101
                dc.w    %1010101010101010
                dc.w    %0101010101010101
                dc.w    %1010101010101010
                dc.w    %0101010101010101
                dc.w    %1010101010101010
                dc.w    %0101010101010101
                dc.w    %1010101010101010

Of course, any other pattern can be used.
