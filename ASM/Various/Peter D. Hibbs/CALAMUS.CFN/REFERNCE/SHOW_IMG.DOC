ENTRY PARAMETERS        d0=ref point x co-ordinate
                        d1=ref point y co-ordinate
                        a0=address of buffer which holds font data
                        Clipping rectangle defined or disabled

EXIT PARAMETERS         Font name displayed on screen as a bit image.

DETAILS -

This routine is used to display the Calamus  font  name as a bit image in a
rectangle approximately 160 pixels wide by 16 pixels high. Registers d0 and
d1 should first be set to the required x and y  co-ordinates, the reference
point for the rectangle is  the  top  left  corner  of the image. Note that
these values can be negative values if the reference co-ordinate is off the
screen area, the routine will just show  the area of the character which is
visible on screen. If the clipping rectangle is active only the area within
the rectangle will be displayed

Set register a0 to the start of the RAM buffer holding the font data.

Since the  routine  uses  the  'vrt_cpyfm'  VDI  function,  the  source and
destination Memory Form Definition Blocks  (mfdb)  must  also be defined in
RAM as two 20 word stores labelled 'srce_mfdb' and 'dest_mfdb'.

Turn off the mouse cursor, if it is visible and call the routine to display
the character.

The draw mode and  the  display  colours  can  also  be  changed within the
routine, if required. See the CFN_CODE.DOC  file for further information on
this.
