DETAILS -

This routine calculates the x co-ordinate of  a character image which is to
follow an existing character. Adjacent characters  must have the same point
size and must be from the same font.

Assuming that a row of characters are to  be displayed in a line, the first
character image in the sequence is first displayed using the 'show_char' or
'blit_char' sub-routine with the required  x  co-ordinate in register d0 as
normal. Subsequent  characters  are  then  displayed  with  the 'calc_kern'
routine being called before each image is  displayed to calculate the x co-
ordinate required to give correct kerning. The y co-ordinate in register d1
will be the same for all characters.

Before the routine is called the following parameters must be initialised.

Register d0 should hold the x co-ordinate of the previous character image.

Register d4 should hold the  left  x  offset  value for the previous image,
this value is stored in the third  word  of the header block for the image.
This value should be copied  to  the  register  before  the image buffer is
cleared, of course.

Register d5 should hold the  left  x  offset  value for the character image
which is about to be  displayed  and  can  be  read directly from the image
header after it has been generated.

Register d6 should hold the ident code  of the previous character, i.e. the
ASCII code of the character minus 32.

Register d7 should hold the  ident  code  of  the  new character, again the
ASCII code minus 32.

Register a0 should point to the address  of the start of the buffer holding
the font data for this font.

'font_size' should hold the current  divide  value  for  the point size and
'gap' should hold the  extra  pixels  to  be  added  to the inter-character
space. The actual value will probably depend on the current point size.
