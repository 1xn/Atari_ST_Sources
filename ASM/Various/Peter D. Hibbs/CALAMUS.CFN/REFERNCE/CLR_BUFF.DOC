ENTRY PARAMETERS        (font_height) = height of character cell in pixels
                        (char_width) = width of character cell in bytes
                        a1 = address of bit image buffer holding chr image

EXIT PARAMETERS         Buffer cleared to zero
                        No registers changed

DETAILS -

This routine just clears the image buffer  that  is  about to be used for a
character bit image. Before the  routine  is  called the 'calc_top' routine
should be called (as it normally would be) to set the character cell height
and width which are used when calculating the amount of RAM to clear.

Register a1 should be set to the start  address of the image buffer and the
routine then called to clear the  buffer.  This would normally be done just
before the 'make_image' routine is called to generate the character image.

For example :-

        move            #50,font_size           set point size
        lea             font_buffer,a0          locate font data
        bsr             calc_top                set up width, height, etc
        ..
        move            #'A'-32,d7              make chr 'A'
        move.l          #img_buffer,chr_addr    locate bit image buffer
        bsr             make_image              generate chr 'A' image

        move            #100,d0                 set x co-ord
        move            #100,d1                 set y co-ord
        lea             img_buffer,a0           locate image data
        bsr             blit_char               display chr 'A' image

        lea             img_buffer,a1           locate image buffer
        bsr             clr_buffer              & clear to 0s

        move            #'B'-32,d7              make chr 'B'
        move.l          #img_buffer,chr_addr    locate bit image buffer
        bsr             make_image              generate chr 'B' image

        move            #150,d0                 set x co-ord (d1=y co-ord)
        lea             img_buffer,a0           locate image data
        bsr             blit_char               display chr 'B' image

        lea             img_buffer,a1           locate image buffer
        bsr             clr_buffer              & clear to 0s

Note that, in order to clear the  buffer as quickly as possible, the amount
of RAM buffer cleared is rounded up to  the  nearest long word and so up to
four more bytes than is actually required  may be cleared. The routine does
not check whether there is sufficient  RAM  available  in the buffer, it is
the programmers respnsibility to ensure  that  there  is enough RAM for the
operation.
