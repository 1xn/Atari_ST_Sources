DETAILS -

This sub-routine converts  a  compressed  (PC1-3)  or  uncompressed (PI1-3)
Degas file into a picture image. To use  it  first copy the Degas file to a
buffer and set a0  to  the  start  of  the  buffer  (which  must be an even
address). Allocate a 32000 byte output  buffer  (which could be the screen)
and set a1 to the start address. Call the routine which will decompress the
file (if it is a PC1-3 type) and  copy  it to the output buffer. The colour
palette will also be set up although, of  course, if the file type does not
match the current screen resolution, this will not work correctly.

Two word-size stores (k1 and  k2)  are  used  for  temporary storage by the
routines.

Register d0=0 on return to indicate  no  errors (for this routine it always
returns with a value of 0).
