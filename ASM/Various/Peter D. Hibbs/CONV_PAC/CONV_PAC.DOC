DETAILS -

This sub-routine converts a  compressed  (.PAC)  STAD  file  into a picture
image. To use it first copy the  .PAC  file  to  a buffer and set a0 to the
start of the buffer. Allocate a  32000  byte  output buffer (which could be
the screen) and set a1 to  the  start  address. Call the routine which will
decompress the file and copy it to the output buffer. These image files are
high resolution only.

Register d0=0 on return to indicate no  errors  or  1  if the file is not a
STAD type file.
