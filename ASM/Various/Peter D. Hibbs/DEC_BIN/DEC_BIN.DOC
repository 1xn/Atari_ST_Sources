ENTRY PARAMETERS        a0 points at a decimal number in RAM.

EXIT PARAMETERS         d0.l holds binary equivalent.
                        No other registers changed.

DETAILS -

To convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent the ASCII values for
digits 0-9 should be stored in a buffer store in RAM with any non-numeric
value before the first digit  (i.e.  the  Most Significant Digit) and any
non-numeric value after the last digit.  For example, if the number 57902
was to be converted, the data in RAM could then be stored as :-

                buffer      ds.b        $00,$35,$37,$39,$30,$32,$00

The values $00 at each end could be  any  other value as long as they are
not in the range $30-$39, of  course.  The  stores  must be byte size. To
convert this number to binary, set the a0 register to point at any of the
ASCII digits (it does not matter  which  one)  and then call the routine,
the result is returned as a longword in register d0.l.

For example :-

                lea     buffer+1,a0     point a0 at one of the digits
                bsr     dec_bin         convert number, result in d0.l
                ..

buffer          dc.b    0,'57902',0

Note that the number range should  be  from  0 to 8,589,934,591 (32 bits)
and is an unsigned value,  i.e.  positive  value  only. There are no size
checks done within the routine so  any  input value higher than this will
just give a wrong result. Note also that the number should be continuous,
that is there must  be  no  other  characters  within  the number such as
commas, spaces, etc although  the  routine  could  easily  be modified to
allow for these if required.

The decimal number look up table at  label 'dec_table' is the same as the
one used in the bin_dec routine so  that if both routines are included in
the users program, one of the tables should be deleted.
