DETAILS -

This sub-routine converts a  compressed  .PCX  picture  file  into a bitmap
image. PCX picture files are used extensively on the PC by programs such as
PC Paintbrush Plus and since they  are  not screen dependant, they can also
be used on the Atari in high  resolution. Like the IMG format, pictures can
be any size.

To use it first copy the .PCX file to  a  buffer and set a0 to the start of
the buffer. Allocate an output buffer and set a1 to the start address. Call
the routine which will  decompress  the  file  and  copy  it  to the output
buffer. As the size of the output image  may be larger than the normal high
resolution screen it is  normal  to  decompress  the  file  to a RAM buffer
first. The size of the  RAM  buffer  can  be  determined by multiplying the
width (in bytes) by the height  (in  scanlines), in a practical application
this should be  done  within  the  routine  just  before  the decompression
section. The m_alloc BIOS function could then allocate a suitable amount of
RAM and the a1 register set to the start address.

This routine will  handle  high  resolution  images  only  although  the PC
version does also incorporates colour information.  (A mod by any member to
add this facility would be very welcome).

Register d0=0 on return to indicate no  errors  or  1  if the file is not a
high resolution file. Registers d1 and d2  hold the width and height of the
final picture image for use by the calling program.
