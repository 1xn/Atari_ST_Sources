DETAILS -

This sub-routine converts a  compressed  .IMG  picture  file  into a bitmap
image. To use it first copy the  .IMG  file  to  a buffer and set a0 to the
start of the buffer. Allocate  an  output  buffer  and  set a1 to the start
address. Call the routine which will decompress the file and copy it to the
output buffer. Unfortunately the size  of  the  output  image may be larger
than the normal high resolution screen  so  it  is normal to decompress the
file to a RAM buffer.  The  size  of  the  RAM  buffer can be determined by
multiplying the width  (in  bytes)  by  the  height  (in  scanlines),  in a
practical application this should be  done  within  the routine just before
the decompression section. The m_alloc BIOS  function could then allocate a
suitable amount of RAM and the a1 register set to the start address.

This routine will handle  high  resolution  images  only  although the XIMG
format also incorporates a colour palette. (A mod by any member to add this
facility would be very welcome).

An 8 byte buffer should also be defined in RAM for the pattern run option.

Register d0=0 on return to indicate no  errors  or  1  if the file is not a
high resolution file or that there  is  a  flag  error. Registers d1 and d2
hold the width and height of the final picture image for use by the calling
program.
