DETAILS -

This sub-routine converts a  compressed  (TN1-3  or  TNY)  Tiny file into a
picture image. Files  with  the  TNY  extension  may  be  any  of the three
resolutions. To use it first copy the Tiny  file  to a buffer and set a0 to
the start of the buffer (which  must  be  an odd address). Allocate a 32000
byte output buffer (which could  be  the  screen)  and  set a1 to the start
address. Call the routine which will decompress the file and copy it to the
output buffer. The colour palette will also  be set up although, of course,
if the file type does not  match  the  current screen resolution, this will
not work correctly. The reason the  file  must  start  on an odd address is
that the palette information starts at byte number 1 (or 5) so that if this
address is passed to the  set_palette  BIOS  function, the CPU generates an
address error. If the file must be  stored  at an even address, the palette
information should first be copied  to  another  buffer  and the address of
this buffer used to set up the colour palette.

The animation facilities (bytes 1-4 if present) are ignored by the routine.

Register d0=0 on return to indicate  no  errors (for this routine it always
returns with a value of 0).
