DETAILS -

This routine draws a pop-up menu  on screen at the designated co-ordinates.
The menu box is designed using  a  Resource  file  editor and can display a
text menu or graphics icons. The  user  can  select  a menu item by holding
down the left mouse button and moving  the  mouse over the menu items which
will be highlighted when the mouse pointer  is  over them. To select a menu
item the mouse button is released  over  the desired item. The routine then
erases the menu and returns  to  the  calling  program.  The 16 byte buffer
holds  information  on  the  selected  item  which  the  main  program  can
interrogate and then take whatever action is necessary.

The pop-up routine (pop_up) is called when a  menu is to be displayed and a
selection made. A MACRO has  been  defined called 'pop_up_menu' which takes
four parameters. The MACRO format is as follows :-

                pop_up_menu     form_id,x,y,buffer.L

where form_id is the ident of the pop up menu form.
      x is the x co-ordinate of the top left corner of the menu form.
      y is the y co-ordinate of the top left corner of the menu form.
      buffer.L is the address of a 16 byte temporary buffer.

The layout of the return buffer is as follows :-

Offset  Size    Function

  0      W      Ident of selected object or -1 if none selected.
  2      W      Ident of parent object.
  4      L      Address of selected objects string or image data.
  8      W      Status of keyboard ALT, SHIFT and CONTROL keys.
  10     W      String length or image width (bytes).
  12     W      Image height (scan lines).
  14     W      Not used.
