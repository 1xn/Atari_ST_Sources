INTRODUCTION.

This program is used  to  display  sprites  which  have been designed and
stored in a sprite object data  file by the NEOCHROME-MASTER art program.
As well as displaying the  sprite  images  and sprite information, it can
store the hot spot offset  values  for  any  sprite and also displays the
colour palette information.

MAIN SCREEN.

Before the program is run ensure  that  the computer is in low resolution
mode and that the SPR_CHCK.RSC file is  present in the same folder as the
program itself.  Running the program shows  the main screen with a number
of buttons. Some of the options will only  work when a data file has been
loaded into memory.

LOAD (L).

First click on LOAD or press key L to load a data file, the file selector
is displayed. Select a sprite data file (normally with the extension .OBJ
although it doesn't have to be) and click  on  OK. If the file is a valid
sprite data file it will be loaded  into  memory and the main screen will
show the relevant information.

The filename and file size are displayed at the top of the screen.
The filenames of the NEOCHROME picture files  used by the sprite file are
shown in the left box.
The number of sprites stored in  this  file  is  shown  at the top of the
right hand box and the rest of  the  box shows the information for sprite
number 1.

NEXT (UP ARROW).

To display the data for the  next  sprite  click  on NEXT or press the UP
ARROW key, the sprite  number  and  sprite  data  is  shown  for the next
sprite.

PREV (DOWN ARROW).

To display the data for the  previous  sprite  click on PREV or press the
DOWN ARROW key.

SHOW (ESCAPE).

To display the sprite itself click on  SHOW  or press the ESCAPE key. The
screen will clear and the  current  sprite  image will be displayed along
with the sprite number,  width,  height,  x  offset  and  y offset on the
bottom line. Press the UP  or  DOWN  arrow  keys  to  display the next or
previous sprites. Press the ESCAPE key to return to the main screen.

The hot spot pixel will flash on and  off on the sprite image to indicate
its position. Pressing key H  will  disable/enable the flashing. Pressing
key I will hide or  display  the  information  line  at the bottom of the
screen.

COLOURS (C).

Click on COLOURS or press key C  to display the colour palette. Note that
when the sprite file is  loaded  the  program  loads the beginning of the
first NEOCHROME screen  picture  file  (usually  screen  0)  and uses the
palette from that file. If any sprites  are stored on other screens which
have different palettes, the sprite colours may be incorrect.

The colour of each index  and  the  numerical  setting for each colour is
displayed. Clicking on any box with  the left mouse button will increment
the colour value and clicking with  the right mouse button will decrement
it.

The numbers in brackets  are  the  GEM  colour  code equivalents for each
index colour code and should be  used  if  setting colours with a GEM VDI
call.

Click on OK (or press RETURN) to return to the main screen.

OFFSETS (O).

Clicking on OFFSETS or pressing  key  O  will  display the OFFSET screen.
This screen allows the hot spot of any sprite (or range of sprites) to be
changed. First enter the offset value into  the x and y offset fields. If
only the current sprite is to  be  changed  (as  shown  at the top of the
form) click on CURRENT. The program  returns  to the main screen with the
new values displayed.

If a number of sprites need to  be  changed  with the SAME x and y offset
values, the first sprite object number  and the last sprite object number
should be entered into the  next  two  fields.  The sprites to be changed
must, of course, be consecutive  numbers.  Click  on  RANGE to change the
specified sprites, the main screen is then re-displayed.

HELP (HELP).

Click on  HELP  or  press  the  HELP  key  to  display  the  key commands
available.

SAVE (S).

If a sprite file has been changed (i.e. hot spot values reprogrammed) the
sprite file must be saved back to disk.  Click on SAVE or press key S and
use the file selector to  save  the  file  as  normal. It is possible, of
course, to change the filename when saving if required.

QUIT (Q).

Click on QUIT or press Q to return to the desktop, a warning message will
be displayed if the sprite file has been changed but not saved.





LIMITATIONS.

This program does not allow  for  the  extra  colours  of  the STE at the
moment, if anyone wants this option please let me know.

The internal buffers are limited to the following sizes.

Sprite data file        400K bytes
Sprite mask buffer      100K bytes
Sprite table            1000 sprites

Sprite data files should not exceed 400K  bytes  (if you need more let me
know) and the number of sprites  not  more  than 1000 (999 is the maximum
anyway). Since these buffers are defined within the program, this program
will not work on a machine with less than 1Mb of memory.

If there are any bugs  found  or  any  extra  facilities required in this
program please let me know, I MAY be able to oblige.
