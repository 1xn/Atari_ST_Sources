This is an assembler library for the Atari Falcon. By using this I hope
to make programming a bit faster and easier. It includes a lot of subroutines
which most assembler programmers use quite frequently as well as some
less frequently used graphic routines. I have tested all routines
and they seem to work ok, but I can't guarantee it. For everything to work
properly use Devpac 3 with ignore multiple includes active. Most things
will probably work nice with Devpac 2 too.

If you have made a routine I would appreciate if you sent it 
to me, that way I could include it in the Falcon Library for the
benefit of everyone. Please send any questions, bugreports
