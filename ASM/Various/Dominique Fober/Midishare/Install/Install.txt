INSTALATION


     MidiShare for the Atari consists in an executable application
    
 "MIDSHARE.PRG". At run time, the application install itself in memory
     
resident. Copy it to the AUTO folder of your boot disk to automatically
    
 launch it at startup. You can also run it manually at any time: just
  
   launch it like any standard application. At installation time,
  
   MidiShare display the following message: "MidiShare resident" followed
  
   by its version number.

Configuration

 

    MidiShare includes a realtime memory manager where the data (including
 
    MIDI data) are represented as structured events. When resident,
  
   MidiShare allocates the necessary memory to store these events.
   
  Configuring MidiShare consists in adjusting the MidiShare memory size,

     according to the amount of events that you plan to allocate at a time.
   

  This size is specified in an ASCII file named "MIDSHARE.INF". You can
 
    modify it using any text editor, but keep in mind to save it in ASCII
   
  mode.
   

  When loading in memory, MidiShare reads the "MIDSHARE.INF" file. It
  
   will looks for this file using the following preferences :
  

     - in the current MidiShare folder
     
     - in the AUTO folder of your startup disk
     
     - when not found, a default value will be used.
