The files in this archive are the MidiShare on-line
 documentation converted to ST-Guide format.

A few words have been changed here and there to improve the English
(only trying to help, Dominique!), but otherwise it is exactly the 
same as the original.

Simply copy MidiShar.hyp and MidiShar.ref into the directory where you 
keep you other ST-Guides. Run STool (provided with ST-Guide) to
add these to your catalogue. 
They will appear under Programming/Others.
