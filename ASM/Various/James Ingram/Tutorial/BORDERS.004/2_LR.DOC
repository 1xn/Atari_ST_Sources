                   The left AND right borders

The left border is a lot more complex than the right border.   It 
won't be killed by using the 60/50 Hz switching.   You have to go 
into mono, and then back into low res.  Twice.

Hmmm...

The code is very similar to 1RIGHT.S, except the left hand border 
code has been put in.   I don't know why you have to go into mono 
twice,  but it doesn't work if either flick is missing.  It might 
work with just one flick on older STs,  but I wouldn't lay  money 
on it.

As  you can now see,  the code for doing the  LEFT/RIGHT  borders 
takes virtually all of the $70 interrupt time.  The only way that 
you will be able to code anything moving on there is the put  the 
instructions in WHERE THE NOPS ARE NOW!

This  means that you must know exactly how long each  instruction 
takes  -  get  a  book  on the  68000  processor  which  has  the 
instruction  times in it!   The flicks must still take  place  at 
exactly the same times, or everything will go Kaput!

     I do not mind you using any parts of my code,  or any  ideas 
     of  mine.   All  I ask is that you give me a credit  for  my 
     ideas or code.  Cheers.
