                       Killing the borders

It  is the fashon now to kill all the borders on the  ST  screen.  
These documents,  source and program files will explain how  it's 
done.

It  uses a combination of flicking in and out of 50/60 Hz and  in 
and out of mono resolution.

The timing is very important,  and all the processor time is used 
up!   It will be up to you to replace the NOPs with your code  to 
move stuff around or play music!

By the way, my NOPs look like this:

     dcb.w     10,$4e71

for 10 NOPs.   This is because I use "rept / endr" a lot, and you 
cannot nest repeat loops.   So I've stuck in the actual hex  code 
for the instruction.

If  you try to alter any of the code involved (eg replacing  NOPs 
with  other  code),  make  sure  you  know  the  exact  time  the 
instrution  takes,  and  remove the appropriate number  of  NOPs.  
Lists  of instruction timings can be found in many books  on  the 
68000  chip.   Look  for books with "68000"  in  the  title,  not 
"Atari", because I've never seen an atari book give them out!

Finally,  a  quick note - My code for busting the left and  right 
borders is a modified version of code originally written by  TEX, 
and modified by Digital Insanity.   It didn't work on my STe, but 
I fixed it.

A  LOT  of respect to whoever first coded this  stuff...  how  on 
earth did they work it out?   When to flick into mono..  etc?  It 
must have taken weeks!   But the originator's name is lost to  us 
(unless TEX's code is original, of course; conceived by him, that 
is).


Enjoy.

And understand.

Hopefully.
