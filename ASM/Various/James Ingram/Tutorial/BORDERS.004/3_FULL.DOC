               Full screen - no borders anywhere!

The only borders left are at the bottom of the screen.   So to my 
2_LR  source  code,  I  added the code to flick  out  the  bottom 
border.   Then  I put in the code to take out the left and  right 
borders (the same code that I had used before).   And what do you 
know? It worked after the first compile!  Cor!

Just a quick glance is enough here!

Actually,  it's not a COMPLETE screen,  because you can't use the 
top  scanline.   I  am in the middle of syncronising in  the  top 
scanline,  so I can't bust the left hand border.   Also,  the top 
scanline  is  about  4 pixels to the right of  the  rest  of  the 
screen!


Now a few notes about the new screen layout.

The  first  (useless) scanline is 160 bytes long as  per  normal.  
But from then on, it gets a little complex...

Each  new  scanline  has  230  bytes.   But  these  are  not  all 
displayed.   As far as I can see (on my crappy TV  monitor),  the 
display begins 8 bytes into the scan line,  and continues for 192 
bytes.  This gives a grand total of 32 new pixels we have gained.  
Of course, you might see more on a better monitor.

The screen length is now 59730, but the nearest 256 byte boundary 
is at 59904.   If you're coding for STes only,  then you can,  of 
course, ignore the 256 byte boundary.

Once  again,  I will say that the inspiration for this code  came 
from  a  source  code I've seen by TEX,  which  was  modified  by 
Digital Insanity.   It didn't actually work (on my STe), but just 
a couple of modifications got it running beautifully.   They  did 
use  Timer B,  but this meant that they could only  bust  borders 
some way down the screen.  My code runs on the $70 interrupt.

A note to TEX and Digital Insanity,  if they are  reading;   good 
code,   meaningful  comments  (top  marks),   meaningful   labels 
(excellent)...  but...  PLEASE try not to use absolute address in 
your  source code for the screen!   A lot of sources  have  these 
blasted absolute addresses: 

EG
screen    equ  $78000

and they only work on certain machines (above example is half-meg 
only).  USE THE BSS SECTION!  That is why it is there!

Whinge over.

     I do not mind you using any parts of my code,  or any  ideas 
     of  mine.   All  I ask is that you give me a credit  for  my 
     ideas or code.  Cheers.
