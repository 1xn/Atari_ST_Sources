                          Nice patterns

Originally,  this was a pattern generated from the Lorenz Strange 
Attractor.  However, ST Format never replied to my request to use 
their  source code,  so I have had to change.   This is  a  pity, 
because I prefer the Lorenz.

You know what an oval shape is - like a stretched circle.   I got 
the  equation of how to draw one from my mum (a  maths  teacher).  
It is very simple.   You have 2 points in the centre of the oval, 
call  them  A  and  B.   I  assume they  both  have  the  same  y 
coordinate.

To get the shape of the oval,  we calculate each point using  the 
equation:

x=A*cos(angle)
y=B*sin(angle)

By changing the angle each time,  we get an  oval.   Boring.   So 
every time I get a point,  I change the size of the  oval.   This 
gives me a nice spiralling pattern.  WHen it gets too big, I make 
it  go the other way,  and all sorts of things appear.   You  can 
mess  around with the source code and change the positions  of  A 
and B to get other shapes.

Because  there  are more than 255 places on the X axis  that  the 
sprite  can appear,  we need a WORD to represent it in the  data.  
Notice  how I do this at the bottom of the code,  by dividing  by 
256 and saving out 2 seperate bytes.

     I do not mind you using any parts of my code,  or any  ideas 
     of  mine.   All  I ask is that you give me a credit  for  my 
     ideas or code.  Cheers.
