                           Big sprites

Big sprites deserved their own special mention.   The ball sprite 
which I have been using needs to be masked everywhere.   The  big 
sprite,  however,  has straight sides.  So the mask does not need 
to be done sperately.   We can work out what it should be by  the 
position  of the sprite.   If the sprite is at 1,1  for  example, 
then we want to keep the leftmost part of the screen only (on the 
left hand side), so the mask is:
%1000000000000000

If the sprite is at 8,8 then we want to lose the right hand  byte 
of data from the screen to make way for the sprite,  so our  mask 
is:
%1111111100000000

What I have done is drawn up a list of 16 possible masks,  and  I 
just look up the value I require.

I have done a similar list for the right hand masks.

But that's not all.   If you think about it, because there are no 
holes in the big sprite, we don't have to worry about masking out 
the middle part.   We can just slap it in with a  MOVEM,  becuase 
it's going over the old screen anyway!

This saves us some time.  If you have a big sprite with irregular 
sides,  then  just use a mask for the sides,  and as soon as  you 
can, get into slapping the MOVEMs in, to speed things up.


Big  sprites,  then,  don't  need to take as much time  as  you'd 
expect (as long as they don't need a complicated mask)

     I do not mind you using any parts of my code,  or any  ideas 
     of  mine.   All  I ask is that you give me a credit  for  my 
     ideas or code.  Cheers.
