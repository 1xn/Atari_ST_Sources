                  Getting rid of the top border

Everyone can do this,  right?   Well,  not if you don't know how.  
It's a simple technique, actually...  All you do is, at the right 
time,  flick  into 60Hz and then back into 50Hz.   The  code  for 
doing that part is...

     eor.b     #2,$ffff820a.w

     rept 8
     nop
     endr

     eor.b     #2,$ffff820a.w

And how to do it at the right time?   Simply install your routine 
on the $70 vector.  What the routine does is this...

put status register on stack
turn off all interrupts
store registers on stack

pause for around 14900 clock cycles

flick in and out

get registers from stack
get interrupt status from stack


How do we pause for 14900 clock cycles?  A simple pause loop:

     move.w    #1064,d0
pause:
     nop
     dbra d0,pause


And that's all there is to it.... almost

Timer C will interfere,  and cause flickering every few  seconds.  
To prevent this, simply disable timer C.

To  see  the  effect  of timer  C,  assemble  1_TOP.S  with  c_on 
commented out.  Notice the flicker.

The  macros c_on and c_off are in MACROS.S,  and are only 1  line 
long.

Everything else should speak for itself.

     I do not mind you using any parts of my code,  or any  ideas 
     of  mine.   All  I ask is that you give me a credit  for  my 
     ideas or code.  Cheers.
