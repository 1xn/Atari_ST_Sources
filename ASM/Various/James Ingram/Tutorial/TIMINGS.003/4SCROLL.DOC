               Scrolling message in bottom border

You  already  know  how  to  make  the  top  and  bottom  borders 
disappear.   You  already  know how to scroll  a  message.   This 
should be simple.  It is.  In theory.

What makes this source code (just slightly) more complex is this:
I don't want to hang around executing NOP instructions when I  am 
waiting to get rid of the top border.   So I use this time to  do 
SOME (not all) of the scroll code.

First I get the screen address,  set the screen address, and slap 
in the screen palette.

Then I move to the bottom of the screen addresses.

Now,  I can fit in 71 MOVEM instructions,  which shift a total of 
3962 bytes.   Another,  quicker,  MOVEM takes the processor  time 
used to EXACTLY where I want it.   Flick in and out of 60Hz.  Set 
up timer B to do the bottom border.  Then just do the rest of the 
scroll code as normal.


To  keep it fairly simple,  I've used the old scroll  code  which 
shifts 160 bytes per line,  not 152.   It's slower, but easier to 
understand at this stage.

     I do not mind you using any parts of my code,  or any  ideas 
     of  mine.   All  I ask is that you give me a credit  for  my 
     ideas or code.  Cheers.
