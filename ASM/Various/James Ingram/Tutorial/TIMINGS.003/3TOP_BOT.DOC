              Getting rid of top and bottom borders

This is just a combination of the previous two programs.   Set up 
the  VBL  (at  $70) to get rid  of  the  top  border.   Then,  it 
initialises timer B to get rid of the lower border.  Easy as pie.
Except that timer B is called on the 228th line now,  instead  of 
the 199th.

     I do not mind you using any parts of my code,  or any  ideas 
     of  mine.   All  I ask is that you give me a credit  for  my 
     ideas or code.  Cheers.
