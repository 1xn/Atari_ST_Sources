                      More about samples...

Using Timer A to get the next sample is OK...  but what if you're 
mucking about with the borders?   An interrupt can occur at  just 
the wrong moment;  or switch off Timer A, and then the sound will 
give  out a nasty noise between samples,  as it will  be  playing 
nothing for a fraction of a second.

The solution?  NOW we get complex...

This is for advanced students only!

Do not use Timer A.  Instead, set up a small buffer (512 bytes is 
enough,  but  a couple of K is easier to get your  head  around).  
Set this buffer off to play forever.  DO NOT initialise Timer A.

Do  all  your border stuff on the $70 interrupt.   When  you  are 
through,  you  have a bit of code to work out what bit  of  which 
sample is to be played, and slap it in (about 130 bytes is enough 
when playing at 6KHz).

Sounds simple?   I've tried it.  It ain't.  Put in TOO MANY bytes 
each  time,  as  a safeguard.   Check the address that  was  last 
played,  and go from there each time.   This routine will  really 
get  tough when you try to mix samples...  it was at  that  point 
that I just thought of lots of better things to do.   After  all, 
who REALLY needs samples...
