                 Sine-Wave Wobblers Introduction

It  has been the fashion for some time now to have silly  sprites 
doing  wibbly things somewhere on screen.   They  usually  follow 
some sort of sine-wave pattern.   These documents are designed to 
enable you to code these sorts of things.

YOU WILL NEED:
     - a good knowledge of 68000 coding
     - a good knowledge of the ST screen layout
     - Devpac Version 2 or above
     - GFA BASIC or something similar
       (given away free with ST Format in 1992 - I think)

There are several files you should have.

On this disk there should be a directory called  "INCLUDES".   In 
it should be, amonGst other things, files called:

     SPRITE.PI1
     SPRITE.DAT
     SPR_PAL.DAT
     WAVE_1.DAT
     WAVE_2.DAT
     WAVE_3.DAT

     MISC.S
     INIT.S
     MACROS.S
     SAVE.S

Don't worry if you don't have the .DAT files, as you can generate 
them with the source code provided.

These are the files I shall be using for my programs.

These  documents may be freely distributed as long as you do  NOT 
delete any files, or change them in any way.  Oh - you can change 
them  if  you  spot a mistake,  but be sure  to  point  out  your 
changes.

I make no guarantee that any of this actually works.
