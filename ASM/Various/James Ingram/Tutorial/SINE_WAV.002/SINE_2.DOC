The  second  sine-wave source code is just a  slightly  optimised 
version of the first one.   The calculations for the sprite  line 
address and screen offset are done before the main  routine,  and 
stored in a list.   So in my routine,  I just have to pick up the 
ready-made answers, to save a bit of time.

Also,  the  code to put the sprite on screen is no longer a  dbra 
loop,  but  a couple of MOVEM statements,  which do the job in  a 
fraction   of  the  time.    If  you  can  think  of  any   other 
optimisations, let me know!

The pre-shifting routine,  which was specialised to this  sprite, 
has been replaced by "PRE_SHFT.S" in the INCLUDES  folder.   This 
routine will preshift a sprite of ANY size!

     I do not mind you using any parts of my code,  or any  ideas 
     of  mine.   All  I ask is that you give me a credit  for  my 
     ideas or code.  Cheers.
