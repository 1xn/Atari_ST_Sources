More optimisations in SINE_3!   Another dbra is a casualty  here.  
There is now a "rept / endr" so that the code to do all the lines 
of the sprite run one after the other.   No looping back saves  a 
few precious clock cycles.

The  list has altered too.   Now I no longer have to add  on  the 
sprite address.

Adding other things has also been speeded up slightly.

     add.l     d0,a0

is quicker than

     add.l     #160,a0

so all the additions take place from registers.   This means that 
I have fewer registers for the MOVEM,  but as long as I have  the 
same number of MOVEM instructions, that's OK.

     clr.l     (a0)+

is faster than

     clr.l     -8(a0)

so  the two CLR instructions at the start of printing the  sprite 
have been replaced.

     I do not mind you using any parts of my code,  or any  ideas 
     of  mine.   All  I ask is that you give me a credit  for  my 
     ideas or code.  Cheers.
