                 Playing Samples With No Borders


Since the timers are used to get rid of borders,  they cannot  be 
used  to play samples at the same time.   You may think that  you 
can use Timer B for getting rid of the lower border,  and Timer A 
to play the samples.  No.

What if Timer A interrupts in the middle of Timer B?  No get-rid-
of-lower-border!  So you'll have a flickering lower border.

And as for the top border,  either you let Timer A interrupt (and 
get a jumping screen),  or you turn it off while you bash the top 
border (and distort the sound).

There is only one solution.   You must write everything to run on 
the $70 interrupt.   Get rid of the top and bottom  borders,  and 
left and right if you want, and ALSO output sound every once in a 
while.

The timings must be perfect.  Want to try it?  Go ahead.  I won't 
attempt  it,  because  it would take far too long.   It  is  much 
better to play samples if you're on an STe, and just rely in chip 
music for STFMs.

Some demos actually have full screens with digital sound.  I must 
respect whoever coded that for their patience!  I just don't have 
that amount (well, maybe one day...)
