ROUTINES.ZIP contains my common routines

Things like the File Selector and file handling
are done here by most of my progs.

Use LINKST.TTP (comes with GENST3) to link progs
which have been written to use the routines.

You _CAN_ "include" these files into your source, but then
the PRG file gets enormous!
