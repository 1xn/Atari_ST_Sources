This is a really basic window dialog as only one window is on screen so
no provision is made for partial redraws, and I haven't tried using it
when part of it is offscreen.

To 'activate' the dialog use the Up/Down arrow keys then type in data.
You should be able to change objects & move the window around and still
enter data. To 'deactivate' either press Return key or click on button.

To exit click on window close.

The ASCII text listing is written with a tab spacing of 8. To keep it
short I've cut out everything except the essentials.

Have fun  - comments etc more than welcome
