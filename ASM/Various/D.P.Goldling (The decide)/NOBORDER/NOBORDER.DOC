      * Removing the Lower Border in Assembly Language By D.P.G. *
      ************************************************************

    This article will explain how to  remove the lower border from within
machine language, using the TIMER B interrupt.

    As you should know, the  display  screen  that  you are looking at is
updated 50 times a second, or  50Hz.  Without getting too technical, it's
drawn by an electron beam, which starts  at the top left corner, and then
draws to the top right. When this line is complete, the beam moves to the
next line, and so on.

    In low res, there are 200 lines  to draw, so this process is repeated
for all 200 lines. On the 200th  line,  the electron beam is sent back to
the top left corner, and the  process  is  started  again. In 50 Hz mode,
this is done 50 times per second.

    The electron beam gets it's information from what's called Video Ram,
which is where the actual screen  display  is stored in memory. The Video
Ram will function perfectly, except for  a  split second, if it's changed
to 60 Hz. Once it has corrected  itself, it will then function as normal.
However, it does not tell the electron  beam to stop drawing, so the beam
will carry on regardless, and  continue  to  draw until instructed by the
Video Ram.

    So, if we can track the  electron  beam  (or to give its proper name,
Video Shifter) and when it's on line 200,  change to 60 Hz, it will begin
drawing in the Lower border, this is  where  we use Timer B. Timer B does
exactly what we need here, and  that  is  to track the beam itself. There
are many uses for Timer  B,  like  colourful  rasters that appear in many
demos, or palette switching, etc, but for this program, we will use it to
just track the beam.  We  can  then  write  a  routine  that switches the
frequency to 60 Hz on line 200,  where  the Video Ram, will get confused,
the beam will carry on drawing, and we have no lower border. We then have
to change back to 50 Hz, and carry on as normal.

    Simple eh! Well this is  one  way  to  remove  the  border, but in my
opinion, it's the easiest  to  understand.  I  have written some Assembly
source to go with this article, which displays a DEGAS.PI1 file, starting
approx 30 lines down, so the  bottom  of  it  is in the lower border. You
will find this file in  the  Assembly  folder and it's called NOBORDER.S.
It's fully commented, so it shouldn't be too difficult to follow.
