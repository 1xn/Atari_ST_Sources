Joypad extension v0.1
=====================

Not much to this extension. Its about 400 bytes in size, with 1 instruction.
(you might notice that  the name has  changed from  the command in my Falcon
Extension with the same purpose - this is to  prevent colisions if you  have
both installed...)

x=jagpd(port)
==============

This function returns a binary value giving the state of each of the 21 keys
on a Jaguar controller connected the the extended controller port PORT (0-1)
The value returned allows the programmer to detect any  combination of keys.

The bitwise representation of this value is :-

  1 4 7 * 3 6 9 # 2 5 8 0 o p c b a r l d u

Where o = option, p = pause, a/b/c = fire buttons   r/l/d/u=directions,  and
the others are keys on the "phone pad".

Each bit can be tested by anding with the bitwise value

 ie 10 x=jagpd(0) : if (x and %10) then down
    20 if (x and %1) then up
  
I am told that the new 'Pro-controller' has the same  values as the existing
control pad, except that the 3 new buttons X,Y and Z are the same as 7,8 and
9 (and will show up as both).  As I don't  have the Pro-controller, I cannot
confirm this.
