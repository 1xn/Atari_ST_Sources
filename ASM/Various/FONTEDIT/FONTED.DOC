PROGRAMMERS FONT EDITOR - Copyright 1990 Andrew Younger
=======================================================
Public Domain, copy and distribute, but don't sell!!!!!


Requires to be run on a colour system in medium or low resolution.


        This program is basically an 8 by 8 mono (just one colour
characters!) font editor I wrote to create fonts, for some of my
own programs. Most 8/16 bit programmers will recognise this type
of system, and at one time will probably programmed one on one
machine or another. So my main reason for releasing this into
PUBLIC DOMAIN is to save them the agro of writing yet another
one.


Instructions:
=============

        All the possible functions are displayed down the side of
the zoom grid, and are all pretty self explanatory - any you are
not sure about experiment with!.

PLEASE NOTE: The load and save options, only read files from the
directory the program was executed from, e.g. All the readable
font files, have to be in the same folder as the executable.


Tempus II:
==========

        I am not sure about this but judging by the demo of
TEMPUS II - the CCD text editor - the file format of my fonts are
the same as the Tempus 8x8 font format, therefore this program can
be used to design fonts for it.


File format:
============

        The file format is very simple. The characters are held in
order from characters 0 to 255 as bitmap data. ( e.g. 8 bytes of
data for each character ) so for example to reference the bitmap
data of character 65 you would just get the offset of the start of
the fonts and add (65*8) to it. An example of how the fonts would
be driven, can be found by looking inside the font editors source
code (should be supplied with this doc), search the file for the
label create_at:


Liability:
==========
  
        I take no responsibility if anything bad happens after
using this program.
