
   I  have noticed a problem with a source code, which I sorted out in the
   end.  The  program  works  fine  on  its own but the source code needed
   adjusting for my Devpac 3 assembler. The problem is where does the code
   $1B  come  from,  as  it  does work in centering my text on the example
   *TEST1997.S*  but  I cannot find any trace of it in any gemdos calls. I
   found  *TEST1996.S*  on  FaST Club disk IN120. My question is are there
   any  old  books,  that have the original gemdos call that is not in the
   later editions ?
