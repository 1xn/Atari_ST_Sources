HELLO AGAIN,THIS SAMPLE OF A MINI WORD PROCESSOR WAS CREATED OUT OF TRIAL
AND ERROR. IT HAS PROBABLY BEEN DONE BEFORE BY BETTER PROGRAMMERS, BUT I
HAVE NOT SEEN ANY SAMPLE YET TO DATE.THE MAIN PART OF THE PROGRAM CAME
FROM INPUT & OUTPUT OF AN ASCII CHAR. STEP 4 ATARI ST MACHINE LANGUAGE
* ABACUS SOFTWARE *. THEN FROM THE SAMPLE OFF THE FIRST ATARI PROGRAM
* HELLO WORLD * IN WHICH I WAS ENQUIRING ABOUT $1B CODE (GRATEFULLY 
EXPLAINED BY JASON J RAILTON. THANK YOU.)...
                                            PLEASE NOTE THAT I ADDED
TO THE SOURCE CODE:
 CENTER:  MOVE .L   #PUT,-(SP)
          MOVE      #9,-(SP)
          TRAP      #1
          ADD.L     #6,SP
THIS WAS PLACED FIRST ON THE CODE.

NEXT WAS TO CHANGE THE ALL CODE CONOUT MOVE.W  #2,-(SP) TO PRINT A
CHARACTER MOVE.W  #5,-(SP). THEN TO CHANGE THE RETURN CODES FROM WARMSTART
MOVE.W  #0,-(SP)
TRAP    #1 
TO RETURN MORE GRACEFULLY
MOVE.W  #20,-(SP)
MOVE.W  #$4C,-(SP) PTERM
TRAP    #1
NEXT WAS THE PLEASANT REQUEST*PLEASE TYPE HERE* AND IT'S POSITION ON THE
SCREEN.
PUT:    DC.B  $1B,'Y**PLEASE TYPE HERE*,35,5,0

AS I MENTION BEFORE THIS WAS TRIAL AND ERROR.
                                             I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS SAMPLE,
PLEASE NOTE THAT I MAKE NO CLAIM ON THE PROGRAMS AS IT MAY HAVE ALREADY 
BEEN DEVELOPED BEFORE HENCE****NO CLAIM****

THANK YOU
JNO.   

P.S. I AM INTERESTED TO FIND OUT WHAT REACTION THIS HAS WITH OTHER
PRINTERS AS MINE HP DESKJET600 DOES FORM FEED BUT NEEDS THE RESUME BUTTON
PRESSING FOR IT TO WORK.
