ENGLISH DAYS TO NORWEGIAN DAYS  * 5,NOVEMBER,1997.*

AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF TRYING TO CREATE A MINI WORD CHANGER OR TRANSLATOR.
THIS PROGRAM ENG2NRSK.PRG, CAME IN FROM THE COLD FROM TRIAL AND ERROR. MY
FIRST PUZZLE WAS THE FUNCTION TO GET THE PROGRAM TO CONTINUE, AFTER TWO
TRANSLATIONS IT WOULD RETURN, MUCH TO MY ANNOYANCE AS I DEMOSTRATE BELOW.

START:    MOVE.L   #CENTA,-(SP)--------|
          MOVE     #9,-(SP)            |
          TRAP     #1                  |
          ADDQ.L   #4,SP               |---DO THIS METHOD TWICE AND IT
MESSAG:   MOVE.L   #ENGLA,-(SP)        |   WILL WORK NO PROBLEM.
          MOVE.W   #$A,-(SP)           |
          TRAP     #1                  |
          ADDQ.L   #6,SP               |        
ANSWER:   MOVE.L   #NORSKA.-(SP)       |
          MOVE.W   #9,-(SP)            |
          TRAP     #1                  |---DO THIS THREE OR MORE AND IT
          ADDQ.L   #6,SP               |   WILL REVERT TO THE TWICE METHOD
WAIT:     MOVE     #2,-(SP)            |
          MOVE     #2,-(SP)            |
          TRAP     #13                 |
          ADDQ.L   #2,SP      ---------|
          
AS YOU WILL SEE FROM THE SOURCE CODE, I CHANGED THE METHOD WHICH SEEM TO
WORK FINE. BUT IT LOOKS A LONG WAY ROUND TO A SMALL PROBLEM, SOME OF YOU
WILL LOOK AT SOURCE CODE AND WILL SAY, I HAVE A BETTER WAY. IF SO I WOULD
LIKE TO SEE HOW EASIER IT WILL BE. ALSO YOU SEE THAT THE CHARACTER 0 IS USED
TO REPRESENT THE UR IN NORWEGIAN.
                                 WHY NORWEGIAN I HEAR YOU ASK, WELL A LONG
STORY, BUT THE END RESULT WAS THAT I WANTED TO ANOTHER LANGUAGE WITHOUT
SUCCESS AT THE MOMENT.
TO USE IT TYPE IN MONDAY PRESS *RETURN TWICE* TO GET MANDAG THEN *RETURN*
THEN REPEAT FOR TUESDAY AND ON AND ON.HOPE YOU ENJOY IT 
                            J.N.O.
