Assembler CRC routines for all 68xxx cpu's
------------------------------------------

CRC (cyclic redundancy check) is very public to validate data, e.g. during
data transmission via modem. In such cases it's often necessary to do this
check very quickly so errors are found as soon as possible.

During my programming on a mailer for Atari computers I have written highly
optimized assembler routines to do this check.

Everyone can have access to this routines. If you're using them in your
own programs you have to refer to me as the author.

It's forbidden to charge _any_ money for the library or the source code!

Hope it does help you! :-)
