ENTRY PARAMETERS        A0 = source address
                        A1 = destination address
                        D0 = Length or -1

EXIT PARAMETERS         None

DETAILS

Copies string at (A0) to (A1)  (A1  can  be same as A0), thereby converting
each letter - including  accented  letters  where  possible  - to upper- or
lower-case respectively. The copying  will  end  when the first encountered
null has been copied, or when the  given  number (in D0) of characters have
been copied, whichever occurs first.  If  you  enter  -1  for length, up to
65535 characters will be copied if no null is encountered.

Non-letters will be copied unmodified.  Note  that not all accented letters
have upper-case versions in the Atari/PC  character set and these will also
be copied unmodified.


Example:
        moveq   #-1,D0   ;null-ended string of indefinite length
        lea     string,A0
        lea     (A0),A1  ;convert in place
        bsr     UPPRCAS

string  dc.b    'MÜrten Lindstrîm',0

... will result in the string being converted to
string  dc.b    'MèRTEN LINDSTRôM',0


As written the routine will  convert  only  those letters which don't clash
with the  IBM  graphics  characters.  Plus  I  took  the  liberty  to treat
characters 155 and 157 as o and O slash, the way they are in Protext.

But alternative character tables are supplied  as  comments in the code, in
case you want to make use of the full Atari character set, unmodified.

You can also make any  changes  within  the  character tables, for instance
just restoring 155 and 157 to  be  treated as separate characters (they are
really the Currency and Yen symbols when not in Protext).
