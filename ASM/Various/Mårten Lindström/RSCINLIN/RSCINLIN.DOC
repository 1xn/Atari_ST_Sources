 Routines to enable the embedding of a GEM resource in the program file.
 Also see the RSC_TO_S program by Keith Baines in Ictari 21.

                               ---------------

 This is a revised version of the routines published in Ictari 21.

 RSCREL  now performs both the  tasks  of  address relocation and coordinate
         conversion - plus it has got a bug corrected that prevented it from
         return anything sensible in D0.)

 RSCFIX  has  been  simplified  though  with   no  change  in  its  function
         (parameter passing unchanged).

 TREEFIX has been deleted. (There was seldom any use for it.)

 GETTREE is unchanged but complemented with GETFRSTP and GETFRIMP to get the
         address of a pointer to a free string/image.

 RSCFIX now is to be used only with resources embedded as SOURCE text, while
 RSCREL (called with identical parameters)  is  the  one  call to make for a
 resource embedded as a BINARY file (whith Devpac directive INCBIN).

                               ---------------

 To embed an external resource  (handled  by the RSRC functions/macros) into
 the program make the following changes:


 Change the lines      filespec:  dc.b     "SOMTHING.RSC",0
              and                 RSRC_LOAD #filespec

      into either      rscaddr:   INCBIN    SOMTHING.RSC
              and                 lea       rscaddr,A4
                                  bsr       rscrel

          or else      rscaddr:   INCLUDE   SOMTHING.S  ;RSC as source
              and                 lea       rscaddr,A4
                                  bsr       rscfix


      Also change                 RSRC_GADDR #0,#xxx

             into                 move      #xxx,D3
                                  bsr       GETTREE


           ( and                  RSRC_GADDR #15,#xxx

             into                 move      #xxx,D3
                                  bsr       GETFRSTP )

 And finally delete any           RSRC_FREE

 SUB-ROUTINE NAMES   RSCREL, RSCFIX
 BRIEF DESCRIPTION   Convert coordinates in (+ RSCREL relocates) RSC file
 FILENAME            RSCINLIN.S
 OTHER RESOURCES     Devpac AES library (for RSRC_OBFIX)
 LANGUAGE            Assembler (Devpac 3)
 AUTHOR              M†rten Lindstr”m

 ENTRY PARAMETER     A4->file to be converted/relocated

 EXIT PARAMETER      RSCREL: D0: 1=No error, 0=Unknown elements in file
                     RSCFIX: None
 DETAILS

 Use RSCREL with RSC files included (with Devpac directive INCBIN) as binary
 files - i.e. as they stand.

 Use RSCFIX with RSC files  in  assembly  source format (e.g. converted with
 the RSC_TO_S program of Keith Baines, or  produced with my RSCDEFS macros -
 See Ictari 21.)

 Both routines convert all coordinates, in resource file, from characters to
 pixels.

 RSCREL in addition relocates all longword  pointers  in RSC file pointed to
 by A4. I.e. adds address of file start  to  them. D0 will be zero on return
 (and processor Z flag set) if any unknown element (unknown object type) was
 encountered in file; even in  this  case  all recognized pointers will have
 been relocated though.

 As it stands RSCREL will only  relocate  pre-TOS4 RSC files, i.e. excluding
 colour icons. But I  have  included  a  code  sequence  to  deal with TOS4+
 extended RSC files as well, as  comment  lines.  All  you  have to do is to
 uncomment this sequence. (Be warned though that I haven't been able to test
 this part, since I haven't got TOS4 - or a Falcon - of my own.)

 Example:

    lea rscfile,A4
    bsr rscrel
    ble error
    ...

 rscfile: INCBIN X.RSC


 SUB-ROUTINE NAMES   GETTREE, GETFRSTP, GETFRIMP
 BRIEF DESCRIPTION   Get tree address
 FILENAME            RSCINLIN.S
 OTHER RESOURCES     -
 LANGUAGE            Assembler (Devpac 3)
 AUTHOR              M†rten Lindstr”m

 ENTRY PARAMETERS    A4 -> RSC file
                     D3: index of tree /free string /free image

 EXIT PARAMETERS     GETTREE:  A3 -> Tree
                     GETFRSTP: A3 -> POINTER TO free string
                     GETFRIMP: A3 -> POINTER TO free image
                     D0: 1=OK, 0= This high index doesn't exist

 DETAILS

 Loads A3 with address of tree (or address of POINTER TO free string/image),
 within resource pointed to by A4 and the number of which should be given in
 D3. At exit D0 (and  processor  flags)  set  according  to: 1=OK, 0= Tree/-
 string/image of this high number doesn't exist in resource.
