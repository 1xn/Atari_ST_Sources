
 This routine is a generic AES tree-walker.  It was published as part of the
 RSCINLIN file in Ictari 21, but  hasn't  anything  in particular to do with
 embedded resources.

 For a tree-walker in C - see the  routine map_tree by Tim Oren (part 13) in
 Ictari 24.

 It can be used for all sorts of operations that you want performed on every
 object within a given (sub-)tree.

 BRIEF DESCRIPTION   For each object in (sub-)tree runs custom routine

 ENTRY PARAMETERS    A3 -> Tree
                     D2: Start object (= 'root of sub-tree')
                     A0 -> Custom sub-routine to run for each object

 EXIT PARAMETERS     D0 will contain whatever custom routine sets it to

 DETAILS

 Will for each object in a (sub-)tree run a custom sub-routine pointed to by
 A0. The main tree should be pointed to  by  A3, and the number of the start
 object should be given in D2. (If D2=0 the whole tree will be done.)

 At sub-routine entry A3 will point to the tree, A2 will point to the object
 and D2 will contain the object number. All registers can be freely used and
 all registers EXCEPT D0 will be  restored  at  TREEDO exit. D0 will contain
 whatever the custom sub-routine sets it to; TREEDO won't touch it.

 Processor condition flags will at exit be  set according to a test of D0.L.
 (Should you want word format for  the  test  of the exit parameter you will
 have to change TREEDO correspondingly.)
