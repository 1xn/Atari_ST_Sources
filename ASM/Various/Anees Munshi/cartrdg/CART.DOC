	README -- version 1.0

	This directory contains the files you need to put together
	an instruction manual on how to build a read/write cart-port
	interface.

	The files include:

	cart.man -- The document that describes how to build it and
		    how it works.

	cart.cs2 -- A b/w degas picture encoded with Moshe Braner's Scode.
		    The picture contains a schematic of the interface.

	cart.s   -- Assembly language subroutines to read and write to
		    the port. While reading this port is straightforward,
		    writing isn't, so you might need these routines. You
		    can link these in with software you write.

	poke.c   -- Test program to exercise the hardware you have built.

	cart.pal -- PAL equations to burn the PAL. If you are not near
		    a PAL burner, translate these equations into 
		    logic and use discrete logic chips. The equations
		    are pretty straightforward to translate.



	All the best!
