			NOLOCK

Did you ever catch your Caps Lock key with the edge of your hand
and only find out about it several lines later?  Either learn to
touch-type, or use NOLOCK.

This is a resident program that disables your Caps Lock key.
Normally it would be run from the AUTO folder, but it can be run
any time.  Subsequently, the Caps Lock key will be effectively
ignored, provided only the two XBIOS interfaces are used to change
the keyboard mapping table.

Verified on a 520ST with TOS 1.0 only.
