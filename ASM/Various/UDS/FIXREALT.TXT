Day 1

17:55, Empa
YEAH!!! I'm the first person to write 
some sucking text in this incredible
REALTIME-text... The party is quite fun
(or more like funny!!)... OB, PQ and
Magic Fingers hasn't showed up yet but 
they will come in about 15 minutes...
 So long so good...
 
18:08, Jag
 OOOOOOOHHHHHHH!! it's jag of Dtvm 
 covering (bet„cker) the keys!!! i'm not 
 interested in writing this shit so i 
 have to write a little story. When I
 was ut cycling in the summer this 
 happened : A nice girl called Jessica 
 Melkersson came and fucked me. Read 
 more about it in JESUS M-DEMO %100...
 Now I have to quit because I am very 
 gay and romantic and I'm going to fuck
 with a boy in zeal now...  
 
18:22 Eagle
 AHH... My car was filled with 
 anatomica's crap and computers... But 
 now everybody is here and I can give 
 back the car to the real owner...
 This party is going to be great... 
 
18:30, Empa
 OB, PQ and MF just arrived (OB stinks 
 - as usually?!)... Now its time
to code some for the TCC-party compo... 
Well... This sucks...

18:31, Hegge 
 ™™™h, well I'm still alive :-)
 
19:02, Sven 
 It's just junk on the fucking tv, and 
 Rubbish will not stop play techno...
 
19:53,  PeyloW
I have just started on my latest piccy 
for Egles game,   it seems to be a
rather nice one.   Talkin' about Egle,   
he do not seem to be sucha happy
about being responsible for this party.   
He even says that he will 
abandon the comming "Party".   To bad,   
maybe we just vote!!!
I am tired of this crap so lets write 
an erotic "novel" in swedish...

Det var en g†ng p† en f”delsadags fest i
s”dra kinda en liten pojke som 
hette fredik,   n†ja inte en s† liten 
pojke,   men i alla fall.   Glad
till sinnet och med en liter hembr„nt i 
fickan cyklade han till festen.
Pojken drack glatt upp spriten och levde
 livet glada dagar.   Fram†t sm†
timmarna s† tr„ffade Fredrik en flicka 
vid namn Nilla.   Fredrk blev d”
k„r.   Fredrik tog mod till sig. (inte 
med flaskan som han f”r l„nge sedan
hade druckit upp) och bj”d upp Nilla som
utan att tveka tackade jag.
D„r stod han mitt p† dansgolvet med
flickan i sina armar och k„nde hennes
styva br”st v†rtor smeka hans bringa.
Inte kunde han v„l d† r† f”r att
snoppen fick eget liv.   Nilla smekte
l„tt med sin v„nstra hand „ver 
Fredriks jeans.   "Kom s† g†r vi n†gon
stanns mer privat." viska hon i
Fredriks ”ra och l„t sedan tungan leka
l„tt i hans ”ra innan hon fattade
hans hand och ledde ut honom ur rummet.   
	Med ett ljudligt klick l†stes
      d”rren och Nilla v„nder sig om.   
Hon slickar sig om l„pparna och tar ett
litet steg framm†t mot mig.
Hon pressar sig h†rt mot min kropp och
gungar p† h”fterna i cirkel r”relser
mot mitt k”n.   Jag l†ter mina h„nder
smeka henne fr†n ryggen och ner mot
hennes h”fter d„r jag drar upp hennes
blus ur byxorna och b”rjar att sakta 
kn„ppa upp dom en efter en.   N„r jag
kn„pper upp den ”versta och sista 
knappen s† b”rjar hon att sp„nna upp
mitt b„lte.  Jag ”ppnar hennes blus och
l†ter den glida ner ”ver hennes skuldror
Hennes vita spetts beh† d”ljer
ett par fasta och toppiga br”st.
Jag befriar med l„tthet dem fr†n beh†ns
f„ngelse och hon drar ned mina byxor.
Hon kn„pper upp min stjorta och
kysser mitt br”st med fuktiga l„ppar.
Hon forts„tter ner†t och kysser mig
p† magen och till sist drar hon ner mina
kalsonger och smeker min penis med
sina varma h„nder.   Hon drar till baka
f”rhuden och kysser ollonet. 
Jag smeker hennes br”st med v„nster hand
samtidigt som jag tar av henne 
byxorna med den andra.   Byxorna faller
ner p† marken och jag smeker henne
med den fria handen mellan hennes heta
l†r.   Hon kysser mig p† halsen och 
drar ner mig i s„ngen vid hennes sida.
Jag hj„lper henna att ta av henne
trosorna och smeker henne l„tt ”ver de
fuktiga blygl„pparna. Hon vrider sig
under min l„tta ber”ring och tar min
penis i sin hand.   Hon fucktar sitt
pek och l†ng finger mellan sina fyllaga
l„ppar innan hon b”rjar att smeka
mitt ollon med dem i l„tta cirklar.
Hon jag l†ter mina fingrar smeka ”ver
hennes br„nn heta hud.   Jag kysser
hennes br”st i cirklar runt br”st 
v†rtorna innan jag suger in hennes styva
br”st v†rta mellan mina l„ppar
och smeker den l„tt med min tunga.
"Hi hi hi,   det kittlas fnissar hon.
Jag slutar.   "Nej, nej sluta inte s„ger
hon med en len r”st.   Jag suger in
hennes andra br”st v†rta mellan mina
l„ppar och ger den samma behandling.
Och hela tiden smeker jag hennes heta
kropp med mina h„nder som bara vill
smeka mer.  Jag l†ter mina fingrar en
efter en smeka ”ver hennes blyg l„ppar
innan jag l†ter den smeka ”ver den lena,
s†rbara huden p† innan sidan
av hennes l†r.  Jag kysser hennes mage.
L†ter tungan leka i hennes navel
innan jag slutligen kysser hennes sk”te
fyllt av honung och hemliga dofter.
Min tunga smeker runt hennes klitoris,
”ver hennes blyg l„ppar och in i 
hennes hemligaste skrymslen.   Hon
vrider sig av njutning f”r min tungas
lek.  Jag h„ver mig upp mellan hennes 
s„rade l†r.   Hennes slida ”ppnar sig 
som en nyuppslagen ros f”r mig innan min
penis sakta glider in i hennes sk”te.
V†ra kroppar m”ts i en sakta rytm p† 
jakt efter njutning.   Hon smeker mig 
”ver nacken och ner ”ver min rygg.   Jag
smeker henne med mina h„nder med
l„tta r”relser.   ™ver hennes fylliga 
br”st.  Och hennes blyg l„ppar som 
ger vika f”r f”r min penis j„mna rytm.
Hon plaserar sina h„nder p† min
stj„rt.   Pressar sina h”fter mot mina
och jag fyller henne med mina safter
samtidigt som hon gnyr av orgasmens 
v†ndor.   Blankt svettiga av njutningens
anstr„ngningar l„gger vi oss vid 
varandras sidor och hennes ljus bl† ”gon
tindrar av lycka n„r hon s„ger... 
"Jag „lskar dig"...

to be continued...

Well thats all for this time.
PeyloW of T.O.Y.S. signing off for now..


21:16,	OB
Well, now I'm here. I'm trying to code
but it ain't that easy to do that
with so much noise and screams and other
stuff going on. We are about 20
pepole in here but sometimes it sounds
like 100.... Hm, back to coding..

22:00     MAGIC FINGERS
Yeeeees,i just love assembler!!! I'm
trying to code a fucking sinus-scroller
but it messes up all the time.Sometimes
i just feel like kicking my ATARI
into small,small pieces......

22:10,	Hegge
Hello again! Now I'm getting something
to eat. A pie. Well who cares?
Later on I'll check what the other
persons have brought to this little
party...  

22:25,	Empa
 It's been a while since I wrote some
words... Just now I'm coding on THE
demo for TCC (We'll win (NOT!!!))... 
Rubbish is listening to some fucking
hardcore TEKKKKNO shit and I'm getting
more and more confused...
My fucking SLIME is not working yet but
just wait...

22:30,    Shamen
I'm currently trying to make simple
PICTURE PACKER for Zeal, it's not 
working at all properly at this moment,
but egnough of that, I'll get 
back to that later.....
My head hurts and the volume of the
crappy muzak in this room is very
(to say the least) loud, and that dosn't
make my head any better!!!!
Well, see you an da AMIGA 1200 soon
(very soon!)!!!!

Over nd out ;-)!

22:35     Magic Fingers
Shamen,i hate you!!! You must be pretty
stupid to buy an lousy AMIGA=AMOEBA.
Atari rules!!!!!!!!

22:36	NooN
What's wrong with Ebba Gr”n i wonder...
I've been trying to make something 
serious by coding on Splayer, but that
idea wasn't to good... The f*ckin' 
window-routs is killing me. Hope da
shit's going to be out on release 
before 1995...;-)  I can understand if
somebody is complaining on the 
volume of the music here, 
coz it's LOUD!!!  Well, what the fuck
to write. I'd better just start working
on Splayer so the other members of Zeal 
kill me, coz my mother would be SO 
unlucky...!!! :-) Ebba Gr”n rulez!

22:45	PeyloW
I am back just to tell you that I have
finished Egles piccy.   It is quite
nice,   I maybe will obtimaze it later.
Now I am going to try some coding.

22:50	Eagle
My brain hurts... I can't code right
now... my thoughts fly away and the 
fuckin' assembler commands fall down in
the mud... Too much sound around 
here but I must get my brain working so
i can code... Peyow has done one
picture more to my TV-scroller so I'd
better make it work now...
Better let someone else use this
computer and continue using my own!


23:37	OB
Hello again, nothing new since last....
Back to coding.... (Or laming.)

23:40	Hegge
Yep, it's me again. I've done some
copying, not fun but some times very
necessary (or how you spell that 
word, i dunno). 

23:43	OB
Hi...

23:45	Eagle 
Better write something... Tired of
coding right now... Perharps we start
a colonial conquest competition now...

23:46 	Jag (Hydrogen, Fredrik)
I don't want to play colonial
konkelb„r... not now, noooooo!!!!

23:54     Magic Fingers
I've just been outside and i must say
that the weather is pretty
bad. I think that it is at least -6
degrees and it snows like hell!!
I hate this place nothing is open this
late at night!!I'm HUNGRY!!

********* Date: 27/12-93 Day 2 *********

00:05:43	Shamen
Yeah, I was the first on dis day!!
I guess Sticky Fingers must have 
something against the A1200, well, 
I don't! I'll just buy it b-cause
the Falcon is so f**in' expencive here
in Sweden! It costs like >1000 pounds!!,
and that's just to bloody much!!!!!
My head dosn't hurt now, so let's scram!
The packer went bezerk ;-(...... 

00:20	Hegge
Shamen had a lot of nice stuff like AM
compils and a little game called 
Zool. I'm copying now and that's 
veerrrrrry boring. Well, almost all the
people are serious but Titus he thinks
that he's some kind of DJ. Ok,
back to the boring work...

00:35	NooN
Why the fuck must Aggression do their
demo Braindamage so fuckin' hard 
to ripp pictures from???  HATE!!!

00:52     Mogge
One of the two Amigaowners at this party
Wow Yeah Beebop!

00:55    Magic Fingers
I've just watched some of MR.(JERK)
Shamen's nice(not) intros!!
And i must say that i don't like the
texts written in these.Shamen
i've got one word for you: 
R E V E N G E !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

01:09 	JAG
I'M writing no again but I don't have
anything to write about so fuck
you and good bye!!!!!!!!!

01:14:07	Shamen
Hata Robert B”gberg!!!!! We're trying
to rip some gfx from Braindamage 
for our "Demosidan" in SHN (Not the 
f**in' Larsa, he he hehehe), but it's
fuckin impossieble, BRAINDAMAGE SUCKS, 
'caus you can't rip the fucking
good graphix!!!! Me and NooN are now
looking at the intro for the 24 1/2 
time in less then an hour..... 
NOOOOOOOOOooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOooooOOOOOo
It didn't work this time either ;-(.....
By the way.... Wildfire (TERA LAMER 
FEDERATION) is now dead......he he he

01:20    Magic Fingers
Oooh,i really love mr.Jerk of the year
(shamen),i don't like when people talk's
about Wild Fire (the Masters).By the way
shamen,eat shit.MERRY X-MAS!!!!!!

01:23:49	STICKY FINGERS
Ooohhh, I'm so stupid..... I'm sooo
stupid..... Once I had a braincell, but
my mother hit me with a baseball bat
when I was born, 'caus she didn't want 
me.. So I don't have any brains any
longer.... My father hates me too.. 
My name is Robert B”gberg... I go to the
"Ekonomiska linjen" at Highschool,
I had an average grade of 2.4 of 5.0
possible, and I think that's pretty
fair beeing at my low level of
intelligence!!!! I think that I can code 
but I don't even know in wich end of the
computer to put the disc....
But my 1st Basic demos are really great,
and my tunes are too... If you're
deaf and blind, otherwise you can not
say that there any good!!!!

01:35    Shamena
Ooooooh,i feel like a woman,yes i am a
woman!!! When i was born my mother and
father didn't believe their own eyes,i
had the body of a woman but a girls
face.Oh yes indeed,it's true,believe
it or not.By the way if some nice 
intelligent boy read's this please
contact me.(i really needs a big man!!!) 
Bye for now! 
Love "Shamena/TMV (THE MANWOMANS)

01:37:18 STICKY FINGERS......
My head hurts,... I just think I had an
idea... that's very unusual, at my
level of intelligence you can be very
happy if you can find your way to the
bathroom on the morning,... I usually
don't, so I just wet my bed, it's 
much simpler, and then I don't have to
clean myself either!!!! WOW!!!!
By the way,... I've changed my name to
NO BRAINS, 'caus I really don't!!!!
If anyone would call me intelligent, I
would take that as an insoult!!
By the way (as you see, at my low level
of intelligence I can't use to many
different expressions, It might make my
brain to blow up, I don't wanna
get an overheat, I't wouldn't be nice...
or, well actually It would, 
'caus then people wouldn't get annoyed
every time I saud anything!!!)
So I think I'll continiue to use some
really unusual words, like.....
Myintelligenceissolowthatisoon-
willbeasintelligentasacarrot
and,... nothat'saninsoulttocarrots,
therereallyintelligent!!!!
ssssssssSSSSSSSSSSSSSPPPPPPPPPPP-
LLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTttttttt
   
MR.Robert H”gberg will -NOT- be joining
us for the rest of his life....
JJJJJJJJJJIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPP-
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!

02:14:23	NO BRAINS
Jess, I'm back, and I think my
intelligence just went to under 0, that  
means  that my brain is no longer
functioning at all, wich means that
I'm braindead, so then I can get back to
my newest project called....
THe ViC 20 Emeratolor IiI!? wich will
have some really cool effects like..
Sime-cuves, Shadsbows, plastp†se,
duiskdrive, m†nitor and a new effect 
called briseier lanijs wich are bredning
ljans!!!!, rally cool!!!!!
Now I gottoooalett go to the m†nitor and
piss, fee wee l”ter!!!!

02:35	Hegge
Yeah, we've got an idea. We're
(Shamen/TCP and I) gonna do a real cult 
dizkin in Swedish. :-) See ya in some
hours and I'll give ya the latest
 'buot da dizkin... Signin' off now...
 Maybe I'll get some sleep, but 
just maybe. 

02:57	NooN
Now we actually managed to ripp the
brain-piccy...!!!  The hard thing wasn't
to ripp the brain, but to ripp it with
just one hand on it... Well, actually
I and Shamen didn't manage to ripp it,
but our (Zeal's) musician did it on
the fifth-tenth try...!  Zeal rulez, 
Larsa sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

03:06	OB
Now everybody is getting a little bit
tired and one and another will
probably soon go to sleep. I've now
fixed my 3D rout and it's more accurate
than before, it will come to good use in
my and Zeals next production.
Peylow is working on a packer for Zeals
digidemo.Doze of Anatomica hasn't
arrived yet and he will probably now
show up either, I'll call him tomorrow.
Now PQ lear is singing a song about
frogs, he must be very tired... and 
so am I... bye...

03:16:45	Shamen
SLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!
zzzzzzZZZZZzzzzzZZZzz   ZzzzzZZZ zzzz ..

03:30     Magic Fingers
Fuck,the sinus scroller doesn't work and
i'm x-tremely tired so i think
i will slepp some hours now,and continue
the the work tomorrow.I'm very
hungry,GIVE ME FOOD!!!

03:32	Hegge
Znark. Well I'm pretty tired. I've
tested Zool on my 1mb/STE and it looks
nice. Simply the best arcade on the ST/E
But the AM compils seem to not
be as good as I hoped. 

03:34    Rubbish
Now i'll go to the other room to get
some sleep, but first i'll go
and wake Titus Alex cause he has already
slept for hours. I'm going
to do some musix to a demo when i wake
up, i have already started,
and it seems to be good. GOOD NIGHT

03:50    PQ Lear
To me, it really doesn't seem like
Rubbish is asleep yet. But he sure looks
tired. Well, I'm getting a bit dizzy too
but what the heck, this is a
convention after all. You're not
supposed to go to sleep before you FALL
asleep... Stupid Empa is coding on the
Amiga.

04:45 	jag
WOW now is only the real entusiasts up
we are now 6 persons here all other
are sleeping in the other room.... Don't
forget to pray, everyday!!!!

05:10	jag
Now are we only 3 up we are losing more
and more people. Yeah it is 
only 50 minutes to the Statoil opening.

05:25 	Jag
Now I'm alone but it is just for now
TAM(jag) is on the toilet but all
other are sleeping so we can do what
ever we want....


08:35	TAM
Now the first persons are coming alive.
Jag is sleeping and snooooring
on the floor. I'm the only one who
stayed up the whole night and I
still got plenty to give. During the
night I and Jag sampled some Pelle
and are going to do a sing-along demo
with his great tune Det lilla ljus
jag har.

09:50	TAM
I'm getting bored with all these fucking
lamers which are asleep in the
room nextdoor. Are they going to sleep
forever? 

10:17	Eagle
Now we are 7 persons awake... Better
code before to much noise starts
but the sounds are increasing fast now.
Probably everyone is awake
in an half hour... now two more gays
is coming in to this room...

Perhaps I would try to found out who the
other people are...

	THE HARD WAY!!!

Lets start...	HEGGE SUCKS!!!
	         ---------------
Now I can found out who is most angry at
me... and then i know who
Hegge is....

10:20	Hegge
What the fuck is this? I  sucks? Well,
fuck ya!

10:24	OB
Morning....

10:26:18	Shamen
I've been awake since 08:45, but I just
forgot to say hello,.......
HELLOOOOOOooooo......

10:55	Eagle	Bonjour Kabarnak!
Well... my computer are occupied by some
sampler freaks... I don't know
anything else to do than occupie another
computer (this...) Everyboby is awake 
now... I think... Perhaps some bastards
is still sleeping...

11:15	Digit
I hate viruses!

11:35     Magic Fingers
Aaaah,i've just bought some delicious
food,so now i'm gonna eat,eat eat.

11:41	OB
Hm, I've just got some food from empa so
I don't have to eat now for
some time. Some weird guy is making a
karaoke demo with religious
music !!!!
Fuck I forgot all my empty disks at home
so I can't copy anything(cry,cry).

11:52 	PeyloW
Good morning Kisa !!!    I have finished
my packer this very night,   and
guess wot?   It works !!!   Well after
some few hours of sleep I ones more
sat down in front of the compi and
improved the packer rout,   and now the
packed length never ever will be more
than 2 bytes bigger then the org.
Quite good i think,   I shall now
convert it to assembler and maybe add
one more algorithm.   (It's greats odds
to that not be done (lazy me))
This party is quite cool so far,   and
Matz will soon come and give me the 
key to the showers.    Thats all for now
   if you want to read more text
then you better read all 105 kilobytes
of scrollers in the -T2- demo by
me,   or shall I say T.O.Y.S.  (I coded
and painted nearly all of it)
Well I leave this keys to someone
else now,   bye. I'll be back!

12:05, 	Empa
Good morning... I been sleeping for a
couple of hours but I'm still kind
of tired... I need a shower... My codes
are all fucked up and I haven't
been able to finnish one little poor
code... (poor me)  DET LILLA LJUS
JAG HAR (g† och sug Fredde!!!)

12:08:56	Shamen
I've just eaten "J„garbiff med pomes
Chat”" and a whole lot of meatballs!
I didn't have any dinner last night you
see,......
Och sj„lv tycker jag att DET LILLA LJUS
JAG HAR e' ganska fin.......;-)

12:25 Rubbish
Hello! Now i'm listening to some modules
by Surf of ICE, they are
great! NooN is a shithead! ha ha haaa!!!

12:29 Eagle
Been thinking of biking home to my place
and get some food so I survive
the rest of the day... I be back within
28.8*10^9 clockcycles...

12:38    Magic Fingers
Well,i've now eaten some food,so i guess
i'll try to code something
now,but since my sinus-scroller fucked
up i don't know what to do.
But there's plenty of things to do here,
you can for example listen
to the song "Det lilla ljus jag har",or
you can...ehh,hrm,well 
to tell you the thruth i must say that
i'm pretty bored at the moment.
But wait,now empa is walking around in
the room with a video camera trying 
to record some stuff.Now back to the
world of Devpack....

 
13:17	Magic Fingers
Hum,hum,why doesn't anybody write here?
(except me off course!!!)

13:29	NooN
Yeah, at last the film for the
Digitizerdemo is ready... Now we just
have to digitize it to disk with
'Vidi-ST'... It seems to work out though
Hmm, if just Rubbish would finish his
tunes every time he starts on a new one, 
then we would have MANY tunes by now...!
He's working on a new tune now, 
and it's quite good... But don't tell
him that...:-)

14:01:41	Shamen
I just read what I supposinly wrote this
night, but I can say this,.....
Magic Fingers has more than 156.42
personaletys so he tinks he is more
then himself..... What I'm trying to say
is that he wrote the whole series
himself!!!!
Signing off..... Ohhh, I just remebered,
the movie of this party's gonna be 
real great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

14:15	Eagle 
Back down here in V„rg†rdsskolan...
Two more persons have appeared then
I was home... I also got a letter to
Zeal with some music on...

14:25     PQ Lear
Duh, still a bit tired... Hungry too,
I hope someone'll think about eating
something soon. That realtime texture
mapping stuff on the PC really
looked good. I think the little movie
will look better with a little blue
in it...

14:47	NooN
Fuck! I want a PC, now!!!  Or, in other
words, I want Doom & CD2...! Doom
is the fastest, coolest, best game ever
made on a computer... Hope da 
Jaguar's game Alien vs Predator will be
just as good... I think it will, 
coz those who bought Jaguar and played
games on it is pleased with it. As 
soon as I have money I will by a
Jaguar... Well, fuck Titus!

15:25	Hegge
Hey NooN! Doom is coming for the Jag.
I'm waiting!

16:06	Eagle
Havn't written anything here for a while
Everybody seems to be tired
here now.. and i am also a bit tired...
Perhaps i should play around a
bit with my old 3d routs... And hope to
get started with some programming
on my game later... PeyloW
(the graphist) is complaining over me
not doing anything on my game....

16:30     Magic Fingers
I've have to comment Shamen's text above
I wrote nothing in the series,coz
i was busy coding something.(although,i
don't remember what..)But hey,
Shamen,it's no danger admitting that you
wrote it all!! I mean,you're
two persons,one man and one woman!!!!

16:41	NooN
Sure Hegge, noon will come, BUT!!! 
A vs P has already come... And you can't
play a game if you don't have it, 
can you?

16:42	Hegge
No ya can't! But by the time the Jag
reaches Sweden Doom will have been
released, June 1994. ;-)

16:47	TAM
Well, because I was totally bored and
some people are asleep I decided to
write some shit here to tell the world
that there is a life after this and
that DTVM claims that they are the only
way to an eternal life. Jag is  a
big lamer because he's currently 
sleeping in my and his chair and
therefore is blocking TWO computers from
the hands of me. As I am a very
reasonable guy I can tolerate almost
anything, but the next party I'm going
to there won't be any members of sŽl at
all. Perhaps they aren't the worst
coders in the scene, but as persons they
are terrible. The only sain person here
except me is OB. There are also some
lamers here, but won't mention their
names because they aren't worthy to be
mentioned here (I don't know their
names). At this very moment two am™boR
are playing a game via a null-modem
and everyone with a stereo in sight are
turning the volume to the maximum
and I'm actually getting tired (after
only 26 hours). Anyway it has been
nice to meet some new people (even
though i despise most of them) and I'm
looking forward to 'attend' to one of
their conferences and be a real pain
in the ass.

17:08 Digit

This Null-modem thing didn't work out
very well. But who cares anyway. I got
 to get some sleep... 

17:41	NooN
Now Hegge is coding a 'Bankomat' in
GFA... Hmm, I maybe should do something
on Splayer instead of writing dis
fucking text...  See ya!

17:47	OB

Now I've formatted some disks so I can
copy some nice modules from Doze
(yes he has arrived now. nice or what !)
We had really funny when we produced the
video for Zeals digi demo. We
repeted what everybody should do around
eight times and Empa ran around
with the videorecorder. My role in the
movie was to walk towards my computer
and insert a disc. The whole movie got
around 37 seconds long. You'll
probably see it around soon.

18:03   Magic Fingers
Hello!

18:12   Rubbish
Why dosen't Noon finish his window-
routines for SPLayer, he has coded
them for a hundred of years but it
doesn't seem to get better! It still
look the same as it did when he started!
Ok, I know he has learnt
everything by himself, (about C...) but
why is SPLayer taking so long time??
Maybee because he's so fucking lazy and
lame!

18:17	NooN
Fuck ya Rubbish!!!  Why don't you learn
C yourself and make Splayer??? It's 
not that easy, if ya think so... Lazy
and lame?  So what?  I'm a real 
hacker!!! :-)

18:18    Rubbish
Ha! I'm not even interessted in learning
C. I'm ony interrested in SPLayer
cause i want a GOOD sample editor! Ok,
i'll stop complaining but do as
good you can and if something is to
hard to solve, ask someone who knows
how to do. Titus and I have hidden some
beers in the snow and will drink
them later... But know i'll go and hit
Noon!

19:34	NooN
I know what Rubbish is interested in...
-Drinking...!  And he's not the only
one, there's a room full of them...!!! 
Well, back to Splayer I hope.

20:03:04 	Shamen
There are many lamers inside Magic
Fingers, 'caus each personality is a 
REAL lamer,... Just look at this guys
roits.... They SUCK!!!!!!! (yes,

kucks!!!) By the way,.... You are all

Wow,i just managed to get my 3d-star
scroller to work properly.And boy i'm
fuckin tired and my head hurt.Message
to Shamen "suck yourself off pal!!"

20:52	NooN
I can't believe it...  The hard thing
with Splayer was to get it to work
with more than one window. I think it
works with more now!!!  I'm HAPPY!!!
Well, back to work...:-|

21:05	Digit

I've spent the last hour fixing a disk.
It worked. I don't beleive it.

I can't believe it... Alcohol is

We have drunk all alchol we have , so
now there is no alcohol left.

I'm actually surprised Struma managed to
write down such a lot of text in
only four minutes. As seen above, his
keyboard sensitivity is down to 
about zero, whatever scale you use.
However, he is acting like a perfectly
normal Swede, keeping his alcohol
peaking with a lot of cider.

At the moment all people who aren't
drunk are either coders or very, very
tired. Unfortunatly am I not very tired
The lot of us that think they
are better then the rest is mostly
coders (but certainly not eMpA). Some
other lamers keep running around and
sw†pping games or dong something else
(like playing games)... Now all the
hammered members of sŽl say that they
are going to buy themselves Am™bOr and
sell their ATARI's. I won't think
that will be a very big loss for the ST
(tv„rtom). I don't understand were
all the stupid, lame and overall bad
Ze„aL-ideas come from (they don't know
either because they are too drunk).

22:30	Empa
Everybody is claiming that I'm drunk
i'am and it's funny like hell !!!!
 	
22:33     Magic Fingers
I can't find my source disk's,where
in hell have i put them.?Usually i don't
give a fuck about this sort of problems,
but since OB wanted to see my fractal
rout i'll guess i will spend a few
minutes trying to find it.
Back to the world of search.......

22:40    Magic Fingers
Now i have found some of my source
disks,but the fractal rout wasn't on any
of these.But i found a assembled version
of the fractal routine....(gl„sch)

22:45	EMPA
YEP... Here I am looking for the key to
the secret (or the secret to the
Bresenheim circle rout!!!)  Rob and
Noon are still playing the fucking
Pinball Fantasies (on Amiga suxer)
Now PQ wants to show us a 'thing' in
Realtime...  HO HO
Eat some stuff or somethng else...

23:10	PeyloW
I have just read all text that have
been written on this compi so far.
It is quite a lot,   and some of it is
even interesting to read.   Well now
I am going to write something realy
boring...   Try this in STOS.
10 for n=0 to 15 : next n : 
   poke $ff820a,0 
20 for n=0 to 2 : next n :
   poke $ff820a,2
And viola the upper border is dead !!!
Some more hints is to turn off all
STOS interupts,   all timer interupts
and off coz the mouse interupt.
The border wont flicker then.
And one more thing,   this one works
only uncompiled.   But what the heck,
who wants to kill borders or even code
in STOS anyway.   (I do!(My packer is
made in STOS))   Talking about this
packer...    Z„„l told me to convert
into asse,   but I shall wait for
that untill everything is ready.
Currently noone even knows if it shall
be three or four bitplanes.   If it
turns out to be four then I will code
one more algorithm if not I will pack
it in bitplane order.    Only Jesus
knows. Eagle (Egle) seems to be coding
now at last,   I just hope that it is
the game source he is editing.    He
got some problems with timer-B interupts
It will be a three bitplane TV-scroller
in borders OVER a four bitplane
picture.    And since the piccys shall
be changed with fades in realtime
he is not able to do any funny tricks.
I have drawn two piccys fonr that
scroller so he better finish it soon.
By the way the morfing clock in the
game is realy great!!!   Take a look
at it.    No,   dont just take a look
at it buy the whole game when it is
finished. (around 1998)
Well I think I have bored you quite a
long time now so I will wrap here.

stupied (as always!) Rob and Titus is
looking on my codes... NO!!! I was wrong
They were looking at ACCS's
'Edge of Panic'...   SHAMEN is talkning
about the U2-concert (in stockholm)
which I missed!!!  Jon gotta Raytrace
my logo soon or I will go mad or
something...  This day we have been

I have just read it all threw(this
document). It took me a while but 
it was worth it every second. There
seems to be very different people
on this party, some perverts and hippies
but who cares ? As long as 
they don't mess with me it's allright.
I have borrowed a TV from some guys in
the neighbourhood. I forgor the
damn remote controler who I need for
Scart-switching. We're leaving this
place tomorrow. OOPPPSS!! Today TUESDAY!

00:16	Hegge
Well, here I'm again. I've crushed NooN
in Sensible Soccer (Amiga). Yeah!
The peze owners are playing around with
the graphic possiblities of their
machines. Raytracing and displaying of
TGA piccys. The demos on 486 are
much better then the Atari ones. But
with that hardware it isn't surprising,
to me. By the way, what kinda hardware
had pezes 1985? Atari was great
in you compared them then but
nowadays, naaaah. :-(

00:30	Rubbish
Oh, this party starts to suck! I think
i'll have some sleep soon, what else
to do??? I'll go and watch the PC's...

00:35	NooN
Hmm, starts to suck? Well... Ehrm...
Shit da' same!  Splayer & Pure C sucks, 
and I mean it. Da shit wount be ready
until 1999 as earliest... But, what
the hell, who cares???  Na, now i better
go looking on PC instead of writing
this fucking text that no-one will ever
read (Except YOU!), cu?

Ahh.. 'Ebba Green' is now running on the
stereo.. I like it !!! Jon is
trying to raytrace an Anatomica logo but
it seems not to work out as
he want it to work out. Empa says we
have to record the digi movie once
again because it is to long but I think
we can pack it down so it fit on the

Huh? I didn't see any borders disappear
(?) The only comment I have to 
this code is that I really don't see any
free time for doing other things
than to wait for the beam... Well, I
guess a nice full screen picture
is quite enough to impress at least
Empa! :-) Regretfully, he still seems
to be asleep. Funny, how people seem
to sleep for an incredible amount
of time and then waking up and walking
around like zombies anyway. Sleeping
is an enormous waste of time. It's
really a pity you would go bananas
without sleeping. Well, I'm still
hanging on to the SDF motto:

At last!   The showers has been opened
for the ones who think its important
whit the personal hygine.   It is not
open for good,   but whit some luck
Matz mybe will show up and give me that
fucking key just one and a half
day to late!!!   Most of the people have
at last awaken after a long nigth
of sleep that I missed.   I have not
slept for one single minute for about
26 houers and I start to feel a it
sleepy.   The one who was upposed to
make the raytraced Dynamic LABS logo is
sleeping on a table.   And wont
do something to my logo the following
houers.   Too bad coz it looks like
if it will be a very nice logo.
I have only seen LABS is some kind of
blue glass and it is marvelous!!!

I dont wanna raytrace!!! I'm the
motherf*cking musician in this group!!!!
would you like to rytrace with a PC
with 4 meg ram???? i mean when 
the raytracer has just been loaded i
have out of memory and that god damn
program starts to use a swap file (if
you dont know what a swap file is
im gonna tell ya right now.. its when
the PC uses the harddisk as a memory
and that means that the computer gets
very slooow!!!!!!!!!)

We have just been video recording just
for fun. We have now a lot of
pictures to look at when we came home.
This is a great tip. If you have
a copy(coding) party then you must have
a video camera and a vidi digitizer.
You'll laugh a lot....
