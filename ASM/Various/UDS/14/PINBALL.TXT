

There is a point beyond addiction - Obsession

This is a sneak preview from the first level of Obsession - THE pinball game
for the Atari STE/Falcon series (one meg required).

Obsession is a state-of-the-art pinball game for the Atari STE and Falcon 030
range of computers, featuring a huge playfield (336*260 pixels) in lots of
colors (more than 40 on-screen), stereo sound (in 5 separate voices), 50 Hz 
screen-update, hardware scrolling, and music and graphics like no other STE
game to date.

Obsession will feature four different pinball tables, each with its own set
of graphics, music, sound effects and gameplay. If you thought you'd seen the
limits of what your STE can do, think again! Obsession will take the STE to
new heights, technically, visually, aurally and, most importantly, play-
ability-wise!

Obsession is made by Swedish software company Unique Development Sweden, and
will be released shortly all over Europe.
