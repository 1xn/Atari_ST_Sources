                      =========================

This fractal-generator is an old code i made for my special-projekt in 
school 1993. It has some unique effects and thats why i decided to 
release it. It is coded in 100% assembler, and every bit of code is made
by me. It was done for the Ste, but i think it might work on a Falcon 
too. If you like it ,send me some money and you`ll see more programs from
me with newer and better code. Here is the controls!


Key-controls
------------
F1 = Generate a 3d picture out of the 2d picture.

F2 = Go back to 2d picture.
 
F3 = Change palette.

F4 = Turn off module. (This makes the calculations a bit faster) 

F5 = Turn on module. 


Mouse
-----
Right button = Go to menu.

Left button  = Zoom in , or select in menu.


Menu options
------------
Julia  = Generate a julia object out of a single point in mandelbrot.
Mandel = Go back to mandelbrot. 

High = High resolution. (More iterations)
Low  = Low resolution. (Less iterations)

Cycle    = Cycle the palette.
Zoom out = Go back to 1:1 and start over.


Enjoy!
