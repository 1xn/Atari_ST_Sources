If you use Codehead's HotWire, place the tiny program hot_mse.prg 
BEFORE hotwire.prg in the auto folder.  This ensures that Mouse 
Tricks gets hold of the Trap #1 vector first, so that program 
execute and terminate calls always go through Mouse Tricks; 
switching mouse modes as desired.
With HOT_MSE.PRG installed, Mouse Tricks disables the option of 
limiting the memory available to a particular program; a feature 
which seems incompatible with programs being launched by HotWire 
(it crashes when they terminate).
