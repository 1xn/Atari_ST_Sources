SUB-ROUTINE NAME      rc_equal.sr
BRIEF DESCRIPTION     Tests two AES rectangles for equality (size and position)
FILENAME              RC_EQUAL.S
OTHER RESOURCES       None
LANGUAGE              Assembler (Devpac)
AUTHOR                JI Logan

ENTRY PARAMETERS      a0 points to array of 4 words containing the x origin,
                        y origin, width and height of one rectangle
                      a1 points to array of 4 words containing the x origin,
                        y origin, width and height of second rectangle

EXIT PARAMETERS       If rectangles were identical d0.w = 0
                      If rectangles not identical d0.w = -1

DETAILS -

Simply loads first rectangle's x origin and y origin in one long word and
subtracts second rectangle's x origin and y origin. If equal does the same
for their widths and heights.

EXAMPLE -   routine to handle a window full button clicked

do_full   wind_get        wind_id,#5      get current dimensions
          movem.w         int_out+2,d0-3
          movem.w         d0-3,cur_x
          wind_get        wind_id,#6      get previous dimensions
          movem.w         int_out+2,d0-3
          movem.w         d0-3,prv_x
          rc_equal        cur_x,ful_x     current window = full size ?
          beq             .setprev        yes - set it to previous
          movem.w         ful_x,d0-3      no  - get full size
          movem.w         d0-3,int_in+4
          wind_set        wind_id,#5      make full
          bra             .update

.setprev  movem.w         prv_x,d0-3      set to previous size
          movem.w         d0-3,int_in+4
          wind_set        wind_id,#5
.update   etc
