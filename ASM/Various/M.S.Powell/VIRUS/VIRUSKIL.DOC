Getting started
---------------
After executing the  file  VIRUSKIL.PRG  you  "should"  be presented with
several icons for you to "click" on.

Icons
-----
        These icons are as follows:-


                A       B

        Examine          Install

        Remove           Exit


Drive icons
-----------

The A and B are the  drives  A  and B respectively. These determine which
floppy drive the virus killer will operate on. If you only have one drive
then you will not be able to select the drive B icon.

Examine
-------

Clicking on the Examine  icon  will  cause  the  virus  killer to produce
information about the disk in the current drive.

This information is:-

Executable, possible virus.

The boot sector is executable. ie the program on this boot sector will be
executed, if the ST is booted up  with  this  disk in. On a standard disk
this should, of course, not be the  case.  If you, yourself, have not put
this program onto the boot sector then  this  may be a virus, and if this
is  so  should  be  done  away   with.  However,  some  commercial  disks
(particularly games) may have a  short  "boot"  program  (now you see why
it's called a boot sector) to load  in  the program/game. If you remove a
commercial disk's boot sector then  you  will,  more  than likely, not be
able to use  that  particular  program  again.  Unfortunately  it  is not
possible for a piece of software, such  as  this,  to tell a virus from a
"genuine" boot program, so you must exercise your judgement when it comes
to getting rid of such boot sector programs.

NB The authors can accept no  responsibility  for disks "damaged" in this
way or any other data loss resulting in the use of this program.

Boot sector not executable

This means the boot sector  will  not  execute  on  boot  up and you have
nothing to worry about.

Anti virus installed

This means an anti-virus (produced by  this program) has been placed onto
this disk's boot sector.

Install
-------

This option will install  an  anti-virus  program  onto  your disk's boot
sector. On boot up this  program  will  simply display the message "virus
free disk" on your screen,  so  that  you  know that this particular disk
hasn't got a virus on it.  If  a  disk with an anti-virus installed comes
into contact with a virus,  the  virus  will  write itself over the anti-
virus. Then the next time you boot  up  with  that disk you won't get the
"virus free" message, because  the  anti-virus  program  has been written
over by the virus program.  So,  on  boot  up,  if  you are expecting the
message and you don't  get  it,  you  immediately  know  that a virus has
written itself on to that disk.  You  can  then  get  rid of it before it
spreads and of course examine  your  other  disks  for the source of this
virus. Also on monochrome systems the  anti-virus will reverse the screen
to produce white  characters  on  a  black  background,  when the desktop
appears.

Technical info....
In no way does  the  anti-virus  "wedge"  itself  into  memory as would a
virus. It simply executes on boot up and is then forgotten about.

Remove
------
If you don't wish to have an  anti-virus  on  your disk, but just want to
get rid of the virus,  then  the  remove  option  will simply, remove any
program that may be present on a  boot sector (including viruses and game
boot programs!)

Exit
----
This option will return you to  the  desktop. (Or to the calling program,
if you want to be pedantic)
