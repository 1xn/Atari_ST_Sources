     This program  will  crunch  an   GEMDOS  executable    file    (i.e.
files   with extensions .PRG, .TOS,  .TTP  &  .APP) into another  single,
but shorter, executable file, thus  using  up  less  disk space, and also
loading slightly quicker. Although  this   file   will  be  smaller  than
the original,  it will still execute exactly as did the longer original.

     The program requires a command line of the following format:-

       [-[h][d][u][i]] <pathname>

Where:-

h   Will hold  screen  when  program   has  finished  (useful  if you are
running   from the desktop).

d   Will stop the  deletion  of  the  original  file. (i.e. will give the
file the extension  .CRU  if   crunching     and   .UCR   if  uncrunching
instead of    using the original file  extension and    thus deleting the
original file).

u    Will   cause   the    program    to     only    uncrunch,   crunched
files,ignoring all others.

i   Will  cause  the  program   to   ignore   errors   (useful  when  one
file  is   generating a read error)

If you use any of the   above   qualifiers  you  must  precede  them  all
with a '-' character.

<pathname> is a standard GEMDOS path

e.g.

-hu a:\bits\*.*

Hold screen on exit, uncrunch all  files in folder "bits" on drive A.

d:\assembler\programs\*.prg

Crunch   all    .PRG    files    in     folder  "programs"    in   folder
"assembler"  on drive D.

-h *.*

Crunch all files on  current  drive  and hold screen on exit.

Crunching files
---------------

     When    a    file    is    crunched successfully  it will be written
back on to disk with the same  name  as  it  had before, thus erasing the
original. There is no need to  worry  about   this  though, as  if a file
doesn't work when  crunched  it  can  be   uncrunched   and  restored  to
exactly as it was before. This shouldn't  happen though as from about 90+
files   I  have   crunched  all  have  worked  perfectly  when   crunched
(honestly!).  (You   can disable  this  deletion  of the original file by
specifying the 'd' qualifier  in the  command  line).  Some files will of
course not crunch at all  and  some  may only  be  reduced  by  a  couple
of  K. However, I  have  seen   certain   program files crunched from 80K
to 20K, so large reductions are quite possible.

     Non-executable   files    will,    of  course,  be  ignored  by  the
cruncher.

     The aim  of  this  cruncher  is  to shorten  files  so that they use
up less disk space, so the  cruncher   will  only write  a crunched file,
back to disk, if it does in  fact   use  less  disk  space, otherwise  it
will generate the message "File uncrunchable".

Uncrunching files
-----------------

     When  uncrunching,  the  uncrunched file   will   be written back to
disk with the same name as the  crunched  file  had. If  you  don't  wish
this to happen then the 'd' qualifier will cause  it  to  be written with
the extension 'UCR'.

Running out of memory
---------------------

     If  you  run  out  of  memory    try  getting  rid of all ram disks,
desk ACCs. Copy the cruncher  onto  the  disk  that  has the  files to be
crunched and execute it from there.  If  this fails then the  only option
is  to  upgrade your memory. A 1 Meg. ST should be  able  to  crunch  any
conceivably  sized  program,   although  a  520  may  have problems  with
very  large program files.

     I   find   the    best    "crunching"  environment   is  to  put the
cruncher into a ram disk as  small   as  possible  (i.e. one  with  about
3K free space) and  then  inserting  the  disks  with  the programs to be
crunched into the  floppy  drive.   You  can  then  crunch  the files  by
preceding the pathname with the drive  number  (e.g. "A:..."). I have the
cruncher write over the   original   files   with  the crunched versions,
because the crunched  versions always  work   and  if you wish to get the
original  file  back  you   can    always  uncrunch   it.  If  you  would
rather the original not be deleted  then use the 'd' qualifier,  although
this  means  there must be enough  free  space on the disk to accommodate
the new crunched file.
