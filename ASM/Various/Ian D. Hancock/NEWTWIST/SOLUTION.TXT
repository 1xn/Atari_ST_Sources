Saying a big hello to all of you out there - esp. those in iCTARi.

This is in reply to Ictari's request for a few modifications to the
Twist scroller of last months disk. I have done a few of the changes,
but I'm afraid I didn't do the colour changes or font changes ideas.

What it does now is load the text from a file SCROLL.TXT without the
need for space padding !
The screens are now in the code (but NOT in the PRG with devpac >v1)
and should be OK for STFM's since they are 256 byte aligned :)
The resolution problem is solved, and it works in med or lo.
The colours which are changed are restored properly.
The screen swap code has been changed for a more logical approach.
Erm I think that's about it................

Hope you like it.

See ya all
byeeeeeeeeeeeeee
