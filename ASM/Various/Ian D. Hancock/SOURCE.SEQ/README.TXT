INFO ON THE SOURCE FILES FOR THE SAMPLE SEQUENCER.
SOURCE CODE (C) IAN HANCOCK 1992
(MORF)

SAM_SE17.C 	= MAIN SOURCE CODE FOR THE PROGRAM
SAM_SE17.LNK	= LINK FILE (USED BY LATTICE C5 LINKER)
			  LINKS THE MAIN C CODE WITH THE MC OBJECT FILE.
			  AND LIBRARY FILES.
SEQ_MC4.S		= THE 68000 ASEMBLER SOURCE CODE MODULE.
			  WRITTEN FOR THE LATTICE ASSEMBLER.
SEQ_MC4.O		= OBJECT CODE (ASSEMBLED) OF ABOVE.

*.H,*.HRD		= HEADER AND WERCS FILES FOR RSC FILES.
*.RSC		= THE RESOURCE FILES FOR THE PROGRAM.

\BASICS\*.S	= DEVPAC 68K SOURCE FOR THE BASIC EXTENSION MODULES.

I DON'T THINK THIS WILL COMPILE ON ANY OTHER COMPILER OTHER THAN
THE LATTICE C5 COMPILER. SOME OF THE LIBRARY CALLS USED IN THE MAIN
C SOURCE ARE FROM THE LATTICE LIBRARY !!

HOPE IT'S OF SOME USE ANYWAY.
SEE YA
