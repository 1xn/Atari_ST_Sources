This  is  the best RAMdisk I know of.   It can  be  configured  to 
install  under any drive identifier,  plus it takes a  minimum  of 
space and effort to set up,  plus it survives a system reset.   To 
use it,  place ETERNAL.PRG in your floppy disk AUTO folder.   Make 
sure  it  is the first thing you put in  the  folder.   Then,  add 
CONFGRAM.TOS.  To configure the disk, run CONFGRAM.TOS, and answer 
the prompts.   To use it,  reboot.  The first time you turn on the 
computer, the reboot which is performed is normal.  After that, it 
shouldn't happen.  One last thing -- Install the correct disk icon 
onto the desktop.
