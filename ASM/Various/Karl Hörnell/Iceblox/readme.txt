Developer notes:

- The game can be played with a joystick in either port 1 or 2.

- Most included .png files contain a list of palette colors on the first row.
A separate program (not included here) was used to convert them to raw pixel
data, as the corresponding .dat files.

- To disable collisions (cheat code) on a level, press the joystick up exactly
5 times during the between-levels screen.
