<p>I thought to add my two pennies just the same here.....
<br>Somehow somewhere someone up there doesn't like you, every time
you dare to buy a SCSI device things go horribly wrong :-)))
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>First of all:</b></dt><dd>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It doesn't matter at all if HDDRIVER recognises your CDWriter,
CDROM or scanner. I know it's a comfort to see these devices
recognised but there's absolutely no need for it. So don't blame Uwe
Seimet for this. For once he's not to blame :-)
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Second:</b></dt><dd>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>If you use CD Recorder Pro, and you want to create a CD, there is
no need for a CD Driver to be installed. The CD Driver needs to be
installed if you want to use the device as a CDROM. Go to the menu
called option, and select recorder. The program will scan the SCSI bus
and display the CDWriter in black, select it and forget all about this
for the rest of your life.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Three:</b></dt><dd>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>If the program doesn't recognise Your CDWriter, then clearly
something is wrong with your setup. My Philips and Teac both don't
like to be the last in the chain, so you could try this. Setting
parity is only good if parity is set on ALL the other SCSI devices
also, so you may have to play around a bit.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Four:</b></dt><dd>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Forget about <a href="1504.html" >ExtenDOS</a>, it's not compatible with SPIN, I imagine
you like to keep the features of SPIN? I know you've got CD Tools,
just stick to that, it's perfect for the job. Use the OLD SCSI_CD.BOS
driver for your Yamaha 200 (see my previous posting) and use
hs_iso.DOS from CD Tools. Your config.sys should look something like
this:
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>;SCSI 4 : PIONEER CD ROM ==&gt;Y
<br>;SCSI 5 : YAMAHA CD200T ==&gt;Z
<br>*BOS, C:\auto\spin_sd.bos, Y:12
<br>*BOS, C:\auto\scsi_cd.bos, Z:13
<br>*DOS, C:\auto\hs-iso.dos -128, O:Z
<br>*DOS, C:\auto\hs-iso.dos -64, P:Y
<br>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>In this example your Pioneer will run with the SPIN drivers and
your CD ROM with the SoundPool drivers, this is necessary because
otherwise it's not possible to read different sessions on a CDR. Also
some CD ROM's have problems reading CD's that are not closed yet.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Five:</b></dt><dd>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Unless you use a Falcon, don't use CDREADER to sample music, this
program is a piece of shit, use CDCOPY.PRG or drag the WAVE samples
from the SPIN CDROM straight into the program.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Six:</b></dt><dd>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>When writing data in different sessions, don't forget to click the
option &quot;read previous session&quot; otherwise your work is
gone....
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Seven:</b></dt><dd>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>When writing a data CD which contains a lot of small files, make
an image first. The SCSI interface of the TT and Falcon are not fast
enough to deliver a constant stream of data to your writer. When using
a Falcon with a fast IDE drive, then forget what I just wrote.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Eight:</b></dt><dd>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>For writing music CD's you don't have to make an image at all. Up
to 6x the SCSI interface can manage.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><b>Nine:</b></dt><dd>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>when writing a real CD-DA always close the CD. A lot of CD players
in the Hifi towers can't manage a CD which isn't closed.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Also have a look to CD Treiber on this archive.
