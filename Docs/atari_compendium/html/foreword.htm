About eight months have passed since <I><B>The Atari Compendium<SUP>&reg;</SUP></B></I>
was first released, and I must admit to being amazed with the
amount of attention the book has received from Atari developers
worldwide. When I started writing the first draft of the book
I didn't know enough about Atari computers to write half of the
860 pages it eventually became. The learning process that I went
through to see the book to its completion was responsible for
a great deal of personal growth and a greater understanding of
computer science in general.
<P>
It was inevitable, of course, that there would be errors in a
book this big. I didn't want to revise the book simply to correct
those errors, however. I was determined to add some missing topics
as well. This first revision now adds about 60 pages to the original
and led me back to the onthejob learning process and several phone
calls and E-mail letters to Sunnyvale.
<P>
The <I><B>Compendium</B></I> now covers almost every conceivable
topic a software programmer needs to know about Atari computers.
You still won't find timing diagrams, pinouts, and hardware specifications
simply because my level of competence in those matters is unfortunately
minor. The only other topics you won't find discussed are those
covered completely in separate volumes (referenced in the <I>Bibliography</I>).
These include hardware-direct ACSI/SCSI/IDE programming, SCC programming,
DSP programming, and direct BLiTTER chip usage. In every case
except for DSP programming, almost all functions of these devices
may be accessed by the average programmer through the use of OS
calls, which are, of course, documented. The basics of DSP programming,
like assembly or 'C' is left to the reader to explore in other
books dedicated to their teaching.
<P>
New to this revision you will find an enhanced style guide and
memory map (the two most popular sections of the book, it seems),
information on programming <B>MiNT</B> device drivers and file
systems, and a section documenting the XBRA protocol. Most importantly,
though, almost every conceivable parameter and return value has
been listed with a corresponding definition name. These names
may be used with any language that supports constant naming, and,
when used, improve program readability dramatically. The TOS.H
and TOSDEFS.H include files will be available from SDS upon the
release of this revision. To find out how to obtain them, be sure
to send in your registration card.
<P>
I owe thanks to Mike Fulton, Eric Smith, and Jay Patton were very
helpful in ensuring that the new material was correct and old
errors were eliminated. Many independent readers of the book also
deserve thanks for taking the time to report errors and submit
their comments.
<P>
In addition, my close friends Dennis, Mike, Keith, Cathryn, Shawn,
Cathy, Shaun, and Krist&yacute;na provided moral support and dragged
me away from work when I needed a break badly. Also, as always,
my mom supported me tremendously and continues to proudly display
a plastic-wrap'd copy of the book to friends and relatives even
though to her its about as useful as a phone book for some remote
city in Alaska.
<P>
Thanks to you, especially, the Atari developers and users who
made this book a reality. Enjoy!
<P>
