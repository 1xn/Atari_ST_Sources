                ST 68K REFERENCE GUIDE VERSION 2.0
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


               Completed on 30th November 1988 A.D.
       (Just before a Computer Science A-Level mock exam).


     With  this  file  you  should  have  received  at  least  the 
following . . .

                           LIBRARY.TXT
                           REF_V2 .ACC
                           PARENT .ID       

     If  any  of these files are missing,  the software  will  not 
operate correctly.  Contact me personally at the address given  at 
the end of this file, send the disk you received with the software 
and indicate where you got it from.

     To operate the software, the file REF_V2.ACC should be placed 
in the root directory of your boot drive, just like any other desk 
accessory.  Reset  the machine,  and the reference guide  will  be 
available whenever desk accessories are available.

     To use the guide,  take the mouse to the desk accessory menu, 
and run it down until 'ST 68k Ref' reverses. Click the left button 
once.  The screen will go blank,  and a standard GEM file selector 
will  pop  up.  This allows you to specify a drive  and  directory 
where the LIBRARY.TXT and PARENT.ID files are.  NOTE:  They should 
always  be in the same directory,  although this directoy  can  be 
anywhere, hard disk, RAM disk etc.

     Once  you  have  selected the  directory,  the  machine  will 
confirm  that  it can find the files,  and then display  the  main 
menu.  This allows you to select which chapter you want to peruse. 
Alternatively, if you press 'X' at the main menu, you can select a 
page to go to. NOTE: You must type two digits here, so if you want 
page 7 type '07'.

     If  you select a chapter,  the program will fetch  the  first 
page in that chapter,  decode it and display it. If you selected a 
page  the  program will fetch it,  decode it and  display  it.  In 
either case you have the option of flipping over pages.  'F' takes 
you one page forward,  unless you are at the end of a chapter. 'B' 
takes you one page back, unless you are at the start of a chapter. 
'S' takes you to the first page in a chapter. 'E' takes you to the 
last page in a chapter. 'Q' takes you back to the main menu.

     On the main menu, 'Q' will leave the program.


To Unregistered Users:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     This software is distributed under the commision-ware scheme. 
This means that if you find the software useful,  you are  obliged 
to  pay  for  it.  Send the sum of EIGHT POUNDS  STERLING  to  the 
address given at the end of this file.  Also include a copy of the 
software, as you received it, on a single sided disk.

     In return for your money,  you will become a registered user. 
You will receive all future updates free of charge as they  become 
available.   You  will  also  become  eligible  for   distribution 
commision.  That  is,  if you copy the software and give it  to  a 
friend,  and he or she registers that copy,  you will receive  TWO 
POUNDS STERLING commision on the registration fee.

     As a registered user, you will receive your own personal copy 
of the software, with a different code in the PARENT.ID file, this 
allows me to identify who sent software to who, and therefore send 
the commision to the right place. For this to work you should only 
copy, and distribute your personal version of the software.

To Registered Users:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Here  is version two of my 'ST-68k-AID',  I have changed  the 
name  to 'ST 68k Ref'.  I don't know why,  but it  somehow  sounds 
better. I don't think future updates will be as quick as this one, 
it's only been a month since version one was sent out.

     This software should carry the same PARENT.ID as your version 
one  copy,  so  you  can distribute this freely  and  still  claim 
commision, (although I haven't received any registrations yet).

     It  was mainly as a result of peoples comments that  I  wrote 
this update,  so feel free to give some more,  and I may  consider 
them.


Improvements Over Version One:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

o    The accessory is now only about 29k long,  as opposed to 82k. 
     This  is  a result of conversion from Fast  BASIC  to  Hisoft 
     BASIC.

o    The menus recognise upper and lower case selections,  so  you 
     do  not  have  to worry about CAPS  LOCK.  Thanks  mainly  to 
     Hisofts '==' comparator.

o    On  termination  the accessory redraws the desktop  and  menu 
     bar. Thanks to Dave Nuttkins of Hisoft for advice about this.

o    The LIBRARY.TXT and PARENT.ID files do not now have to be  in 
     the  root directory of drive A.  They can be  anywhere,  hard 
     disk,  RAM  disk,  etc.  as long as you can take a  GEM  file 
     selector there, and they are together.

o    The decoding of the pages of information, is now at least 50% 
     faster. Thanks to Hisoft.
