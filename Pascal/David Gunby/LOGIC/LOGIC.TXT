Hello, this is the doc for LOGIC.TOS

This is a dead useful program that  allows you to enter a boolean algebra
expression and it will convert it into  a  truth table and a karno map so
that it can be simplified by hand. There is also a file called THINGS.PAS
this needs to be compiled as a unit before you can recompile the source.

   The line should be in the form :-

   .   Logic AND          i.k= i AND k
   ,   Logic NAND         i,k= i NAND k
   +  Logic OR            i+k= i OR k
   -  Logic NOR          i-k= i NOR k
   !   Logic NOT          !i = NOT i     = I
   *  Logic XOR          I*k= i XOR k
   /  Logic XNOR         I/k= i XNOR k

            Case sensitive
            i   Binary Counter     I=!i
            j  Binary Counter     J=!j
            k  Binary Counter     K=!k
            l   Binary Counter     L=!l

            bracket can be used
            )( is expanded to )+(

            so
            i.k                     = i AND k
            I.k                     = (NOT i) AND k
            (k.l)+(i.j)               = k AND l  OR  i AND j
            it's that easy!!!!!!!!!!

            bye bye David
