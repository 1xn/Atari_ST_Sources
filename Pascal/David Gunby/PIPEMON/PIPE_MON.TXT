 Hello, this is the doc for pipe_mon.prg, acc, pas
 ¯  You can run it as a PRG or an ACC
 ¯  All it does is copy all of the messages that AES sends to it into an
    array then displays the array in a GEM window
 ¯  Useless isn't it?

    Yes!
    ByeBye

 PS) You can access print and things like that by pressing help.
 PS) Filter messages means that it won't add messages that are to do with
     changing the shape of the window.
