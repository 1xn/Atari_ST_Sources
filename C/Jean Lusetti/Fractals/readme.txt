* readme.txt for FRACTALS sources *
***********************************
In early 2005, I decided to make the source code of VISION freely available on my website http://vision.atari.org
So I did for FRACTALS too...

**********************
* So, what's in it ? *
**********************
This archive contains the following objects:
FRACTALS\   Well, all the FRACTALS specific stuff

FRACTALS is developped using PURE_C.
Now for the BIG issue...
FRACTALS is an old program I did for the ATARI FALCON. It uses a very old library XGEM I created but I lost sources on a crash...
The "new" (quite amusing to say that now) library is object based and porting will be such a pain to achieve...
If you are interested, you can use the library provided with VISION's sources, but I warn you : it won't be easy...

This source code is totally freely available, use it as you like.
It would be such a nice idea to inform me what you did with it, for FRACTALS or any other thing.


Well, here we are, I really enjoyed developing FRACTALS on ATARI, it was really a big thing to see how 56001 DSP can compute that fast !

Have fun !
