- Something I actually don't know myself:
  When calling appl_getinfo() with opcode 4, what do I find in the 
  short integer the first pointer points at?  The TOS hypertext says that
  it returns 1 for preemptive multitasking and 0 for what? For a non-
  preemptive multitasking or for no MT at all?

- Provide a global sysdeps.h

- Revision of popup classes
