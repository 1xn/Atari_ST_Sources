GEM++ is based on loads of work of others that have contributed their
free software explicitely or sometimes without even knowing it. Others
have tested GEM++, have given advice, made bug reports suggestions
for improvements... I would like to thank in first place all of those 
that I forgot to mention here and:

Andre Pareis, Chris Herborth, JJ Lehett, Markus Gutschke, Ulrich Kaiser,
Christian Felsch, Holger Weets, Mark Richardson, Stefan Eissing, Stefan
Gerle, Ken Hollis, Christian Grunenberg, Ralf Kotzian.
