Changes since version 2.0:

  * Introduced macro "_LIBGEMPP".  All implementation sources
    should define it and header files should only include extra headers
    if it is not defined.  Thus we make sure to catch all dependencies.
  * Tried to use static class components instead of global variables
    resp. static variables outside classes.
  * Spelling of `colour' changed to `color' because both gemfast and
    the AES and VDI itself use American spelling.
  * New header file `yd.h' that redefine all definitions with explicit
    American spelling to British spelling rules.
  * New module aesext that contains all non-standard AES and VDI calls
    with gemfast calling conventions.
  * Adaption to new C++ standards:
    - new ANSI `for' scoping,
    - configure checks for builtin type bool and will typedef bool
      only if necessary,
    - `TRUE' and `FALSE' changed to `true' and `false',
    - re-ordered member initializers to match declaration order,
    - various changes concerning constness,
    - try to make GEM++ compile with -Wall.
	* New class GEMinfo that holds information about OS features.
  * GEM++ is now being built using GNU autoconf/automake.
