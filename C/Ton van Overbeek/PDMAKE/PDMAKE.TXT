    A full featured Public Domain Make for the Atari STs.
 
    Adapted from mod.sources posting (Volume 7, Issue 71, 1986-12-03)
    by Neil Russell and from Jwahar Bammi's port of Neil Russell's
    original net.sources posting.
    Thanks to both of them, they did most of the work and should
    get all the credit they deserve.

    This is not a manual how to use make. For that please refer to any
    UNIX manual, and/or look at the sources and example makefile.

    First Neil Russell's read.me from the mod.sources posting.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Following is a repost of the public domain 'make' that I posted
    to net.sources a couple of months ago.  I have fixed a few bugs, and
    added some more features, and the resulting changes amounted to
    about as much text as the whole program (hence the repost).
    
    For those that missed the net.sources posting, this is a public domain
    re-implementation of the UNIX make program.  There is no manual included;
    for documentation, refer to a UNIX manual, or the source.

    Here is a list of the changes made:

    i)    If '-' (ignore) or '@' (silent) where used at the start
        of a command, their effect was not turned off for the following
        commands.
    ii)   A special target (.SUFFIXES, .PRECIOUS) or a rule (.c.o, .a.o),
        if first in the file would be taken as the default target.
        This resulted in error messages like "Don't know how to
        make .c", because things like .SUFFIXES were being made.
        This was further complicated by ---
    iii)  Special target lines with no dependents (ie. .SUFFIXES:\n)
        were not clearing out the existing dependents like
        they should.
    iv)   Default rules could not be redefined because of the error
        checking for commands being defined twice.  Now you are
        allowed to define a target beinging with '.', having
        no dependents with commands.
    v)    The -q option didn't do the time comparison correctly,
        or clear the variable used to keep track of this.  Thus
        it didn't work very well.
    vi)   The syntax ${..} for macro's supported by UNIX make was
        not supported.
    vii)  There wuz a couple of spelling errors.
    viii) When make checked for implicit rules on targets without
        a suffix, there were problems.  (Note: The ~ feature of
        UNIX make wasn't and still isn't supported)
    ix)   The -n option did not print @ lines like it was supposed to.
    x)    :: added.  (See UNIX manual)
    xi)   $? added.  (see UNIX manual)

Makefile for make and touch:
    makefile  - Alcyon C flavor

Touch:
    compiling & linking touch.c will result in a touch program. Touch
    updates the mod. time of a file to present.
    Usage: touch file file ......

    #define the symbol MEGAMAX at the top of touch.c is you are
    going to compile touch using the Megamax C compiler.
    (Not tested by me)

Atari ST Specific Information:

    ATARI SPECIAL MACROS:

    Since the Atari ST does not have any standard shell, Jwahar built in
    three macros that are useful:

    $(RM)   - removes one or more files, wild cards allowed
    $(CP)   - copies one file to another. NO directories allowed,
              will only accept two arguments, both of which
              must be files. If the destination file exists, it
              will be overwritten.
    $(ECHO) - echo's its arguments.

    All Atari special commands internally begin with the character '%'
    and are handled by routines in ststuff.c. It should be trivial to
    add other Atari Special commands if you so desire. All other
    commands are executed using the Pexec gemdos command, so complete
    path names must be used.

    CONTINUATION LINES:

    The line continuation character is '\'. Back slashes may appear in
    pathname, but NOT at the end of a line, as it will be taken as a
    continuation backslash, and not as a part of the pathname. This should
    not create any big problem as far as i can see.


    DEFAULT RULES:

    See the file RULES.C. Jwahar built in default rules for '.c.o'
    for both Alcyon C and Megamax C. But since both use the same '.o' suffix,
    only one may be built into the version of make that you compile. Which
    version gets built into make depends on the preprocessor symbol
    'MEGRULES'. If this symbol is defined (see H.H) then Megamax rules get
    built in. If it is not, then Alcyon rules get built in. All the rules
    are based on values of macros defined in RULES.C. These macros may be
    redefined in a makefile, and when the default rule is expanded by make
    at runtime, the new redefined values will be used instead.

    Default rules may be redefined in a makefile. This was not possible
    in the original version. An other way to redefine the default rules is
    to edit RULES.C and recompile and link. The values I have used in
    RULES.C are relevant for my setup. (1 Mb 520 ST+, 2 double sided
    floppies, no hard disk). You will probably want to edit them for
    your setup.

    The default rules in RULES.C are as follows:

    .SUFFIXES: .prg .68k .o .bin .s .c .pas

    Alcyon C default rules (if MEGRULES is not defined):

    # Path to the Alcyon C executables
    CPATH = a:\bin

    # C preprocessor
    CP68 = "cp68.prg"

    # C preprocessor flags
    CPFLAGS = -i a:\include\

    # Pass 1 of the C compiler
    C068 = c068.prg
    # Pass 1 flags 
    C0FLAGS = -f   # change to "" if you want to use IEEE
                   # floating point and libm instead of libf
                   # by Default. Otherwise simply redefine
                   # C0FLAGS in your makefile to get the
                   # IEEE floating option.

    # Pass 2 of the C compiler
    C168 = c168.prg

    # Pass 2  flags
    C1FLAGS = # not defined

    # Assembler
    AS = as68.prg
    # Assembler flags
    ASFLAGS = -l -u -s a:\

    .c.o:
    	$(CPATH)\$(CP68) $(CPFLAGS) $< $*.i
        $(CPATH)\$(C068) $*.i $*.1 $*.2 $*.3 $(C0FLAGS)
        $(RM) $*.i
        $(CPATH)\$(C168) $*.1 $*.2 $*.s $(C1FLAGS)
        $(RM) $*.1 $*.2
        $(CPATH)\$(AS) $(ASFLAGS) $*.s
        $(RM) $*.s

    .s.o:
        $(CPATH)\$(AS) $(ASFLAGS) $<

    # Linker of choice
    LINKER = a:\link68.prg

    # Relmod
    RELMOD = a:\relmod.prg


    Megamax C default rules (if MEGRULES is defined):

    # Megamax C Rules default

    # Path to the Megamax C executables */
    CPATH = a:

    # C Compiler
    MMCC = mmcc.ttp

    # Code Optimizer
    MMIMP = mmimp.ttp

    .c.o:
	$(CPATH)\$(MMCC) $<
	$(CPATH)\$(MMIMP) $*.o

    # Linker of choice
    LINKER = $(CPATH)\mmlink.ttp

    Jwahar did not define any default '.pas.bin' rule for OSS Pascal, but
    that should be easy to add.


    How to Compile Make:

    Edit the file H.H. If you want to use the Megamax C compiler
    uncomment the line /* #define MEGAMAX */ to define the symbol 'MEGAMAX'.
    You probably have to edit all the sources to define the symbol 'ATARIST'.
    I do not know how to tell mmcc that a preprocessor symbol is defined.
    If you are using the Alcyon C compiler, leave the line commented out.
    Edit the file RULES.C and the symbol 'MEGRULES' in H.H for your taste.
    If you have the Beckemeyer C shell you may use the shell scripts
    compile.sh and link.sh for Alcyon C
 
    If you don't have the microCshell, then you will have to use these scripts
    as guideline.

    Once make.prg is made, you can safely throw away all the shell scripts!!
    If you intend to use make from the desktop, rename it to make.ttp.
