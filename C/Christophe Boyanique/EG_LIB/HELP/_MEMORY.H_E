
EGlib handles a memory manager that use in a maximum efficient way the memory allocated to the program.
The size in Total is the total allocated memory to the program and to EGlib. This total size can be modified by typing the new one and cliquing to Set; or by cliquing on Minimum or Maximum that use the minimum or the maximum memory size.
›e8›Attention:›e0› To increase the memory size, EGlib makes a Malloc() call and looks if the returned bloc's adress follows the actual memory bloc. If you run this program, then an other or an accessory that calls Malloc(), and try to increase the memory size; it won't work ! You must first try to make the accessory or program releasing their memory.
