Wierd Atari
-----------
This is my Atari port of the Wierd programming language.
Wierd is one of the strangest languages that have ever been constructed and
consists of only two instructions: a whitespace and a non-whitespace. There
are two sample files which work flawlessly with the Atari version and two 
other documents by the creator himself.

If you search the Internet for strange programming language you'll find a
lot of them. Nobody expects you to write applications in Wierd but you may
write a program, show it to your friends and then open the source code.

Wierd is a TOS application meaning that it doesn't use the mouse etc. .
Write your Wierd program in your favorite text editor and then call Wierd:

Wierd <filename>

I would recommend using the .w extension for Wierd programs.
