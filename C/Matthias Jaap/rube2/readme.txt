RUBE II
-------

This is the Atari ST port of the RUBE II programming language. RUBE II is considered
as an "esoteric language" which means that it uses a different way than common
languages (Pascal, C...).

The complete RUBE II archive contains an interpreter written in C, a few sample
programs and documentation. Please note that the interpreter is not pure ANSI.C.
In order to make the Atari version fully compatible with the DOS one I have added
an include for ext.h which is neccessary to have kbit (line 812).

The Atari version was compiled using PureC 1.1. It's a TTP program but it runs on all
Atari operating systems.

Have Fun!
