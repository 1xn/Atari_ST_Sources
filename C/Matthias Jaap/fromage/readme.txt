Fromage ST
----------

This is the Atari ST port of the Fromage programming language.

From the programmer's homepage:
"Fromage was created as an experiment, and is based on the Turing machine model 
and a twisted set of control structures I had made earlier. It also resembles 
BrainF*** to some extent, though at the time I conceived the language I knew it 
very sketchily. Fromage's obnoxiousness and lack of ease of use, so typical in 
obfuscated languages, lie in its 10 instructions which operate on no data type larger 
than a bit. (Well, there's the read and write functions which operate on characters, 
but they can only be operated by switching bits.) 

The complete Fromage archive contains an interpreter written in obfuscated C, a 
"Hello, world" program (K&R said so!), and a 'cat' program which besides printing 
its input to its output includes some documentation of sorts."

The Atari version was compiled using PureC 1.1.

Have Fun!
