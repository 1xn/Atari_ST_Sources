An excerpt of the document:

<CITATION>
D.E. Knuth, <I>Semantics of Context-Free Languages</I>, Mathematical
Systems Theory (1968), pp127-145
</CITATION>

particular to the language can be found here in
<A HREF="doc/turingol.tex">LaTeX</A>,
<A HREF="doc/turingol.dvi">DVI</A> and
<A HREF="doc/turingol.ps">postscript</A> forms.

I've written a <A HREF="./">parser</A> in flex and bison (also tested
under lex and yacc on Solaris and OSF1). It will interprete the
program as well as output a set of tuples that can hopefully be
massaged into the input format of some Turing machine simulator. 
A <A HREF="../turingol.tar.gz">tarball</A> (64k) (including this file) is
available.

<P>

<H2>Compiling</H2>

Simply type `make'; ignore any warnings produced (but tell me about
the errors!). Note you'll need an ANSI C compatible compiler (I'm too
young to know anything about K&R :-) - a GNU development environment
(gcc/flex/bison) is definitely the way to go.

<H2>Doing stuff</H2>

The input files to the parser have the form described in the document
with the addition of perl-style "#" comments. You can also look at
some <A HREF="progs/">sample programs</A> and the bison
<A HREF="parser.y">grammar</A> for inspiration.

The program itself takes the following options:

<P>

<CODE>
turingol [-o outfile] [-r runfile] [-d] [sourcefile]
</CODE>

<P>

where:

<DL>

 <DT> <CODE>-d</CODE>

 <DD> Dump the state of the parser to <CODE>STDERR</CODE> (standard
 bison stuff; <B>very</B> verbose) (<B>default:</B> don't)

 <DT> <CODE>-o outfile</CODE>

 <DD> Compile the program and write the tuples to
 <CODE>outfile</CODE> (<B>default:</B> don't)

 <DT> <CODE>-r runfile</CODE>

 <DD> Execute the machine and write its output to
 <CODE>runfile</CODE> (<B>default:</B> write to <CODE>STDOUT</CODE>)

</DL>
