Mouse
-----
Mouse is a language first introduced by BYTE magazine in 1979. This
is a Mouse interpreter. Although being called Mouse the language doesn't make
any use of the ST's graphic capabilities. Although almost unknown, the language
is not a joke and not an esoteric one.

Portation notes:
I tried to compile it with PureC but the executable had some unexplicable
errors (garbage on the screen). Sozobon worked fine.
