= History =======================================

* 0.00.a.pl6                   30.09.2001     <rtc>
- struct gfainf_t, struct gfahdr_t, struct gfalin_t: Removed '_t'
  in those structure tags.  '_t' as a variable suffix is reserved
  by POSIX and should generally be used for types only, not for tags.
- tables.c: Fixed indenting.  Several lines had tabulators in them
  which really should be space.

* 0.00.a.pl5                   10.09.2001     <rtc>
- Converted the wole thing to C and wrote some funky build toys.
- Translated most strings to German, including this history file.
- Split SKY as a library from the GF4TP token processor program
- Allow negative indent values.
- Handle label indendation case.
- Sometimes superfluous spaces were appended.  In the most obvious 
  cases this was corrected.  Maybe there are some left.
- Each .GFA file is ended by a line which only contains an end 
  of file marker.  This case was fixed to not erroneously output an 
  empty line.


* 0.00.a.pl4                   06.10.1996     <rtc>
- gf4tp_scan_header(): made dimensioning take place *after* the maximum 
  variable count has been being read
- gf4tp_getmax(): New. Does exactly what is says.
- gf4tp_tp$(): Cleaned up the command tokens which are followed by two, 
  four or six bytes of additional information.  Some were duplicate, 
  some at the wrong place (especially FOR and NEXT tokens).
- gf4tp_tp$(): Corrected forgotten addition at SELECT x$ (Noticed when 
  trying to decode ERGO_TP)


* 0.00.a.pl3                   23.09.1996     <rtc>
- gf4tp_init(): Reading variable suffixes
- gf4tp_tp$(): Extreme shortening by using indexed variable suffixes
- gf4tp_tp$(): Fixed forgotten decreasing of variable number in word 
  format variable tokens had been forgotten (noticed randomly)
- gf4tp_tp$(): folded procedures now defined via tokens.
