                   "Popup": The popup menu handler
                   -------------------------------

"Popup"  is a popup menu system for all Atari 'C' programmers to  use.
Popup menus can be called up on demand,  or used as a replacement  for
the standard GEM top menu bar, or both. Why use this popup menu system
instead of another ? Well here are a few advantages:


* A help string may be displayed with each menu item
* Sub-menus to any depth are supported,  (such as those found on  the
  Amiga that only extend to one sub-level).
* No resource file, all menus are compiled along with your main code
* Related options may be grouped together within sub-menus
* Powerful editor supplied with this package allows easy  modification
  of menu definitions
* Works in all three screen resolutions


Interested ?  Good,  now I'll outline the contents of this package and
how you should use the supplied files.


                          The Demonstration
                          -----------------
     In  order for you to get a feel of the facilities offered by  the
popup  menus,  have a look in the DEMO folder and  run  DEMO.PRG.  Pay
particular  attention to the sub-menus and the greyed lines (not  just
rows  of grey minus signs !).  Note that you must keep the left  mouse
button pressed to use the 'Hold down' menu option.
     There are several keyboard shortcuts used in the demo, they are:

ALT-A     "About...."
ALT-C     "Check me"
ALT-Q     "Quit"
ALT-D     "Drop down"
ALT-H     "Hold down"

     The source code to the demonstration program is provided,  and is
discussed in another document. You should really print out this source
code  and try to understand it before you attempt to set out  on  your
own.


                             Limitations
                             -----------
     This  unregistered  version  of Popup  comes  supplied  with  the
necessary  object  code to allow anyone that uses Lattice  'C'  V5  to
create  and  use  popup menus.  Users of other  'C'  compilers  should
register,  they  will then receive the source code to the  popup  menu
system which they may modify and recompile as per their  needs.  Users
of Lattice 'C' V5 should register anyway,  as that's what shareware is
all  about !  See programmers documentation for details of how to  use
the object code and header file.
