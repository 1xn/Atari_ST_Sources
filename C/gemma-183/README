This is the gemma GEM library. It is not yet completely finished, 
though most of the functions should be already functioning. The 
unfinished part is mostly the multidialog support (the library can 
actually handle only one opened dialog box per application).

Take this as a public alpha release.

The source is preconfigured for 68020+ machines. To build plain 68000
binaries edit the file named `config', then just say `make'. Notice that
statically linked libraries associated with the SLB are always built in
two versions (i.e. separately for 68000 and 68020).

Once eveything is built, you may say `make install' and `make libinstall'
to install everything. Before that make sure the env. variables $GNULIB
and $GNUINC point to your /usr/lib and /usr/include respectively, and
$SLBPATH points to a folder where SLB libraries reside.
