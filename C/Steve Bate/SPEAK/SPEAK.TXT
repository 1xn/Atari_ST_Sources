The following program and C source code is in response to the people 
who wanted to use STSPEECH.TOS with file input. The program, SPEAK.TOS 
will accept text from the standard input and generate speech from this
text.  The program supports indirection, so "speak <file.txt" will
generate speech from a text file. To use this program, STSPEECH.TOS
must be in the same directory as SPEAK.TOS.
