Getting Started.

System Requirements.

        . ATARI ST Computer
        . 1 Floppy Disk Drive
        . Colour Monitor (or colour television if your computer has an
          RF modulator)

Set up your computer in accordance with the instructions given in your
owners manual.

Loading DISKCAT.

DISKCAT is a medium resolution program that uses the ST computer's 4
colour, 320x200 pixel display mode.

Your ST must be in medium resolution before you start this program. In
order to set your ST computer into medium resolution follow these
steps;

        1) Insert your working boot disk and switch your ST on.
        2) From the GEM desktop select OPTIONS from the top menu bar.
        3) Click with mouse on SET PREFERENCES.
        4) When the preferences dialogue box appears, click in the 
           MEDIUM box under Set Screen Resolution.
        5) Click on OK.

Your computer will now 'reset' and your display will change to medium
resolution.

Note : If you intend to produce a hardcopy listing of your database
with the LISTDATA function then your boot disk must install GDOS. Your
DISKCAT disk does not include GDOS, you must supply this for yourself.

Once your ST is booted up and in medium resolution insert your DISKCAT
disk into the floppy disk drive. Double click on the disk A icon to
display the disk directory. Locate the file DISKCAT.PRG on this
display and double click on it. After a few moments the main menu will
be displayed.





DISK CATALOGUE SYSTEM

Using DISKCAT.

Once loaded, DISKCAT displays its initial menu. This is a simple GEM
form and allows you to select an operation by clicking on the relevant
button and then clicking OK. The main menu offers the following
options;

        Add A New Record                        - ADD
        Amend An Existing Record                - AMEND
        Delete An Existing Record               - DELETE
        Display Data For A Chosen Subject       - FIND SUBJECT
        Display Data For A Chosen Folder        - FIND FOLDER
        Display Data For A Chosen Program       - FIND PROGRAM
        Load A Copy Of The Latest Database      - LOAD FILE
        Save The Current Database To Disk       - SAVE FILE
        Print A Copy Of The Current Database    - LIST DATA
        Quit                                    - QUIT

Add A New Record.
This option allows you to add a record to the database. When this
option is selected the system displays a new form, you use this new
form to enter the details of the program you wish to add. The details
required are;

        Disk Number  : The number of the disk that this program
                       resides on.
        Disk Source  : A short memo field used to describe where you
                       obtained the disk (ie the name of a PD
                       library or magazine).
        Subject Code : A number between 1 and 25 which is the code
                       number that you have assigned to this type of
                       program.
        Program Name : The name of the executable program file.
        Folder Name  : The name of the folder that the program can be
                       found in.
        Description  : A short description of the program.

When you have entered all the required details click on OK. The record
will be added to the database and the form cleared to allow you to
enter the next one. You can keep on entering records until you click
on the EXIT button.

From the above you can see that you must do a small amount of
preparatory work before using this system. Your disk collection must
be sorted into a logical order and each disk must be assigned a
number. In addition, for each program that you wish to store in your
database you must know the details given above.
DISK CATALOGUE SYSTEM

Amend An Existing Record.
This option allows you to amend the details of a program already
stored in the database. When this option is selected the system
displays a new form. You use this form to enter the new details for
this program.

The process of amending a record is in two steps. Firstly you use the
form to enter the name of the program you wish to amend. Note that the
other fields are displayed and even though you can enter data into
them it will be ignored. Having entered the program name click on OK.
The system will then search the database for that record. If it cannot
find that record it will display an error message and you will be
returned to the main menu.

If the record is found its details are displayed on the form. You can
then use the mouse to move between the various data fields and change
them as necessary. When you have finished click on OK, if you wish to
abandon your changes click on ABORT.

Delete An Existing Record.
This option allows you delete a record from the database. When this
option is selected the system displays a new form. Use this form to
enter the name of the program you wish to delete. When you have
entered the name click on OK, if you wish to abort the deletion click
on ABORT.

The system will then search the database for the specified program and
if it is found, delete the record. If the record cannot be found an
error message is displayed.

Display Data For A Chosen Subject.
This option allows you to search the database for all records which
match a specified subject code. When this option is selected the
system displays a new form in which you enter the code to search for.
If you wish to abort the search click on ABORT, otherwise click on OK.

The system then displays another form. This form will display each
record that matches the specified code in turn. Use the NEXT button to
display the next record for that code or EXIT to return to the main
menu.

Display Data For A Chosen Folder.
This option allows you to search the database for the details of a
particular folder. When this option is selected the system displays a
new form in which you specify the name of the folder to be searched
for. If you wish to abort the search click on ABORT, otherwise click
on OK.
DISK CATALOGUE SYSTEM

The system then displays another form on which the details of the
record relating to the specified folder will be given. When you have
finished click on either button to exit.

Display Data For A Chosen Program.
This option allows you to search the database for the details of a
particular program. When this option is selected the system displays a
new form in which you specify the name of the program to be searched
for. If you wish to abort the search click on ABORT, otherwise click
on OK.

The system then displays another form on which the details of the
record relating to the specified program will be given. When you have
finished click on either button to exit.

Load A Copy Of The Latest Database.
This option allows you to load a copy of the latest database from
disk. This option works in two stages; firstly the database
information is loaded and then the subject code descriptions are
loaded (use SUBJ.TOS to maintain the descriptions). If either of the
files are not available or cannot be read from an error message is
given.

Notes : 1) This option does not warn you that it will destroy any data
           that you currently have in memory. Take care !

        2) The database (DCAT.DTA) and the subject code descriptions
           (SUBDATA.DTA) must be in the same directory as DISKCAT.PRG.

Save The Current Database To Disk.
This option allows you to save a copy of the latest database in memory
to disk.

Note : This option will completely destroy any data previously stored
       in DCAT.DTA, take care !

Print A Copy Of The Current Database.
This option enables you to obtain a hardcopy of the current database.
It will only list to a parallel printer, serial devices are not
catered for. In addition, this option requires that GDOS is installed.
If GDOS is not installed an error message is displayed and you will be
returned to the main menu.

Quit.
This option exits DISKCAT.PRG and returns you to the GEM desktop. Note
that it does not save a copy of the current database before quitting,
you must select that option for yourself if needed.

Installation Notes.
This system will run from any disk drive/RAM disk setup that you may
have and will also run from any folder. However, you must ensure that
all the following files are in the same folder;

        DISKCAT.PRG     - The program file
        DCAT1.RSC       - The System's Resource File
        DCAT.DTA        - The Database File
        SUBDATA.DTA     - The Subject Code Descriptions File

Note : If you are going to run this system from a RAM disk don't
forget that if you change the database you will have to copy DCAT.DTA
from your RAM disk to a physical disk before switching your ST off.

Disclaimer Notice.
This system has been tested on the following machine configurations;
        ATARI 520STFM - with 512k memory
        ATARI 520STE  - with 512k memory
        ATARI 520STFM - with 4meg memory

and has been found to work with no problems. The software has evolved
through three revisions;
        Release 1.00 - The initial release, heavily bug-ridden and
                       swiftly replaced with,
        Release 1.01 - The first stable version. Translated from
                       SOZOBON code to ANSII standard Lattice C code.
                       This revision rectified release 1.00 bugs and
                       added some extra functionality in the ADD
                       option.
        Release 2.00 - This release. A major rewrite which updated all
                       the screen handling for user interaction to
                       make use of GEM. Error checking is much more
                       precise and the system is now quite stable.

Future Enhancements.
In the next revision of this software the author hopes to add the
following enhancements,

        1) To convert SUBJ.TOS to a full blown GEM application.
        2) To improve the quality of the hardcopy produced by LIST
           DATA by making better use of GDOS.
