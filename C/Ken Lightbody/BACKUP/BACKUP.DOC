 BACKUP.PRG is a gem application which will backup a hard disk (or floppy).

 This program will backup files based on one of three methods:

 - All Files
 - Files modified after an entered data and time
 - Files modified after the time and date of the file 'TIMESTMP.HD'

 OPERATION:

    The user is prompted for the type of backup to be used, source and
    destination drives and verify or replace.

    After all operator input is verified all files on the source drive are
    checked to see if it should be backed up.  When a file is selected for
    backup the destination is checked for enough space.  If space is not
    available the user is requested to make a diskette change.  The file is
    then copied to the destination drive under the proper directory, created
    if missing.  When the backup has been completed the program will ask the
    operator if it can create a dummy file on the source drive.  This file
    "TIMESTMP.HD" can be used by this program to determine files that should
    be backed up when run again.

 WARNINGS AND INFORMATION

    1. This program uses GEMDOS for all file operations.  Note that files on
       the destination diskette are not deleted or destroyed, unless being
       replaced by a later version of the file.

    2. There is no provisions for formatting diskettes so you must make sure
       enough are available before attempting the backup.

    3. Currently files larger than the size of a diskette can not be backed
       up utilizing this program.

    4. Currently, when backing up a file the entire file is read into memory
       and then written to the destination drive.  If there is not enough
       memory to read the entire file the operator will be notified.  If
       this occurs try removing desk accessories.


  Please send me any information on problems or improvements that you would
  like to see.  Note that not all situations have been fully tested but the
  need to do easy time base backups of hard drives prompted me to an early
  release.
