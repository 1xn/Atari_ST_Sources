Module STARS.DMO
(Control file: STARS.DKL)

1. This module generates a `starfield' effect. It works in all screen 
modes but I find it functions best with 16 colours or less. In Falcon 
256-colour mode, it can be a little flickery, but try it anyway. It 
seems to be most effective in ST high or Falcon 16-colour modes.

2. There are no flags associated with the module.

3. Variable 1 sets the speed of star movement, from very slow to very
fast. Users of large monitors may prefer higher rather than lower
speeds, and vice versa.
