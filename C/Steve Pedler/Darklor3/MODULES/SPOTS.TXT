Module SPOTS.DMO
(Control file: SPOTS.DKL)

1. This module simply covers the screen in filled circles.

2. Flag 1 lets you choose between circles with a solid fill (best in
colour modes) or circles filled with a standard GEM pattern (much
better for mono modes).

3. Flag 2 either forces the module to redraw the screen at regular
intervals (this is really just as a demonstration of how this is done) 
or not.

4. Variables 1 and 2 set the minimum and maximum sizes for circle
radius. The actual radius set is randomly chosen from between these 
two limits.
