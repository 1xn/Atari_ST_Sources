Module BOUNCE.DMO
(Control file: BOUNCE.DKL)

1. This module displays a sort of bouncing ball type effect, modelled
on a module available for `After Dark' (tm).

2. Flag 1 sets the degree of bounce, from very low to very high
bounce. The higher the bounce, the longer the ball(s) will stay on screen,
and the greater the amount of screen which is covered. For most practical
purposes, `Average bounce' gives good results.

3. Flag 2 sets the type of ball - solid fill (with random colour
selection on colour monitors), pattern fill with one of the standard
VDI patterns, and hollow fill. Hollow and pattern fill give significantly
higher ball speeds than solid fill, but solid fill looks best (especially
on a colour monitor).

4. Flag 3 sets the number of balls, from 1 to 3; the larger the number, 
the slower everything happens because the VDI has to do correspondingly
more work.

4. Variable 1 sets the ball speed; use higher speeds if you are using
more than one ball, or if you have selected solid fill.

5. Variable 2 sets the `tightness' of the parabola. There isn't an 
easier way to describe this! It ranges from 1 to 6, and the higher the
number, the `sharper' is the parabola which is drawn. Probably best to
try this and see. I find that 4 is a good value, but to a certain extent
this depends on monitor size and resolution.
