Module MESSAGE.DMO
(Control file: MESSAGE.DKL)

1. This is a very simple module which accepts up to 3 lines of text
from the user and displays them on a blank screen.

2. Click on Message... in the control panel to enter the message.

3. Flag 1 sets a variety of text effects - italic, underlined, etc.

4. Variable 1 sets the text height, ranging from 10 to 72 pixels (not
all sizes are allowed by the VDI, which will set the nearest 
available lower size to that which you have chosen).

5. The font entry line on the message input dialog is not used and 
will not affect the module's output.
