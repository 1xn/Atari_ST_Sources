Module INVERT.DMO
(Control file: INVERT.DKL)

1. This module is only of interest to monochrome users. It will run in 
modes with more than 2 colours, but the results are unimpressive.

2. The module simply inverts the screen colours of a mono monitor (or 
Falcon 2 colour mode), although it does so in a slightly more 
interesting way than just inverting screen colour registers!

3. The single variable used will change the speed with which the effect 
takes place.
