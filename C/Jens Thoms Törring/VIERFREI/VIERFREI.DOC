 1. Rules
==========

    At the start the pack of cards is dealt out face up in eight columns
    of seven and six cards. You are allowed to move them following certain
    rules or to put them onto to their final places, if possible. The game
    is solved when the whole pack is sorted into four heaps in rising num-
    bers (i.e. ace, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king) for
    each suit (club, heart, spade and diamond). The position of this four
    heaps are in the upper right hand corner, marked with the signs for the
    different suits.

    The rules for moving cards are quite simple :
    1. You are *not* allowed to move more then one card at a time.
    2. You are *not* allowed to take back a card after you put it onto its
       final position.
    3. You can put a card from a black suit (i.e. clubs and spades) only
       onto one from a red suit (hearts and diamonds) and vice versa and
       only, if the number of the card you move is one less then that of
       the card you put it onto (so you can place a 7 of clubs or spades
       only onto a 8 of hearts or diamonds).
    4. To make things a bit easier there are four free places where you can
       put cards which are in the way in the moment. This four free places
       are in the upper left hand corner.
    5. If you are able to remove all cards from a column you can place there
       any card you like.


 2. Hints
=========

    I don't know any strategy to solve every possible game (would be boring
    to play it if I knew) - so I can only give some hints. Even if it looks
    different in the beginning most of the games are solveable - maybe all
    of them are. Since an element of randomness comes in only by the shuffle
    at the start success dependes only on your abilities and planing.

    The first hint is trival - use the four free places with care, otherwise
    you won't be able to move longer columns of cards. Don't let the length
    of columns you put together get to long if there are cards above it
    which doesn't fit into the column. Otherwise you need a lot of free
    places to move the column away to get at this cards. And last, put a
    card only to its final position when you are sure that you don't need
    it any more or there is no other way to go on with the game.


 3. How to Play
================

    To start a new game either press F1 to start a game at random or press 
    F2 and enter a number between 0 and 999999 to select a certain game
    (the number of the game you are just playing is shown in the title line
    of the window, by entering this number you can always repeat it). By
    pressing F3 you can restart the current game if you got stuck.

    To move a card just click on it and move it with pressed left mouse
    button to its destination. To move a card to one of the free places you
    can also click on it while you keep the right mouse button pressed down.

    Even though it is *not* allowed to move more then one card at a time you
    can also move columns - the computer will try to do the necessary moves.
    To move a column (or a part of it) click on the topmost card of the
    column (or the part of it) you want to move and drag it to the desti-
    nation as you would do with a single card. The computer will then show
    and execute all the moves you otherwise would have to do yourself.

    You can also move more then one card to the free places, just click on
    the topmost card in the column you want to move there while holding the
    right mouse button pressed down.

    By pressing <Delete> you can automatically move all cards to the final
    positions if they are certainly not needed any more in the rest of the
    game (i.e. a black 4 will only be removed if there are no red 3's in
    the game any more).

    To take back a move simply press <Undo>. If your last move was to shift
    a whole column you got to press if several times to go back through all
    the moves the computer did for you. If the computer runs out of memory
    this function might be disabled !

    To quit the game press either F10 or click on the close box of the win-
    dow (in the upper left hand corner).

    If you try to make a move which is against the rules or impossible you
    won't get any fancy alert boxes but just a simple 'bing'.

    Of course you can move the window and reduce its size to a kind of icon
    by clicking on the size box (upper right hand corner). Alas, while the
    window is merely an icon you can't play - so use this to hide it under
    some other window when your boss is coming ...


 4. Miscellaneous
==================

    You may copy VIERFREI without any restrictions and pass it to friends
    (or enemies) as long as it is only for *noncommercial* purposes. With
    the help of the included source text you also can change (may be even
    improve) the game (sorry, I didn't translate the comments, I hope you
    can figure out how it works), but if you do so, put in a note or rename
    the game and remove my name from the resource file !

    To play the english version of the game rename the file VIERFR_E.RSC to
    VIERFREI.RSC (throw away the existing file VIERFREI.RSC or rename it).

    For simply playing you need only three of the files :

                VIERFREI.PRG              GEM program file
                VIERFREI.RSC              (german) resource file
                VIERFREI.DAT              contains data for images of cards

    Beside this there are the following files :

                VIERFREI.C                source text
                VIERFREI.H                header file for resource
                VIERFREI.DFN              definition file for resource
                VIERFREI.TXT              german description of the game
                VIERFR_E.RSC              english version of resource
                VIERFREI.DOC              english description
                VF_ICON.RSC               resource for desktop icon

    I don't want to hide that the idea for this game comes from the patience
    FREECELL, which is distributed with WINDOWS. I liked the rules so I re-
    wrote the game for the ATARI. I hope nobody at MICROSOFT is annoyed,
    but I think copyrights don't extend to rules of card games.

    The design of the cards is mostly taken from the pogram PATIENCE by
    Volker Weidner - I couldn't ask him for his permission, because he
    seems to have moved since he wrote his program, but anyway I hope he
    doesn't mind. (Hi Volker, if you read this, send me a letter with your
    new bank account - I tried to send the shareware fees to you, but I got
    it back from your bank in Karlsruhe ...)

    The game is written in black/white only, anybody who want's to change
    this may feel free to do so. All resolutions with at least 640 * 400
    pixels (e.g. ST-HIGH or TT-MEDIUM) should work without a problem (or to
    be precise, all resolutions where the working area of the window is at
    least 600 * 300 pixels). Since only VDI functions are used also grafic
    boards shouldn't pose a problem.

    I hope that the program will also work under MULTITOS, but I couldn't
    test this. So if there are any problems send me a postcard and I'll try
    to fix it (if I got enough time !).

    Here the usual disclaimer :  No warranty is given for nothing !

                             I hope you'll enjoy the game ...
