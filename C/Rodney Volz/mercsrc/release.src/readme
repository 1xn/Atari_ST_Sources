Hello alltogether,

this file is about the status of Mercury UUCP.

Mercury UUCP is Shareware. Here come some rules what you are allowed to
to, what you are NOT allowed to do, and what you are expected to do.


You are allowed to
------------------

- Copy Mercury UUCP as many times as you want, pass it to others
  and distribute it any way you want, PROVIDED THAT YOU DO NOT
  CHANGE NEITHER THE FILE STRUCTURE OF THE ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTION,
  NOR ANY OF ITS FILES.

- Try out Mercury UUCP, test it for one or two weeks

- Use Mercury UUCP steadily, PROVIDED THAT YOU HAVE PAYED THE SHAREWARE FEE.

- Change the sourcecode, compile your own version of Mercury UUCP,
  PROVIDED THAT YOU HAVE PAYED THE APPROPRIATE SHAREWARE-FEE and
  THAT YOU CHANGE THE VERSION NAME AS DESCRIBED IN "release.src".


You are *NOT* allowed to
------------------------

- Gain money by distributing Mercury UUCP or selling it

- Change the sourcecode without marking it as changed
  by updating the version name




The amount of the shareware-fee depends upon the way you use
Mercury UUCP, and who you are. Here's a scheme, showing
what you are expected to pay:

                                           US-$       DM
------------------------------------------------------------
Commercial organizations
using source and binaries:                 160   or   220

Commercial organizations
using only binaries:                       100   or   170

Others, using source
and binaries:                              $70   or    90

Others, using
only binaries:                             $40   or    50
------------------------------------------------------------


You can either remit the money to one of my bank accounts, or just send
it to me via mail.
