Hi Netlanders,

Feel free to copy Mercury UUCP and to redistribute it. Please maintain
the given file structure, and do only pass the complete distribution
file/disk on to other people. I encourage you to have the files put to
archive-servers, BBS systems and so on, or to distribute them via any
kind of network.

I forbid to pass Mercury UUCP to organizations, that gain money from
distributing Shareware or Public-Domain-Software. I further do not
allow these organizations to distribute Mercury UUCP.

Hello ya all, out there on the net!

Okay; I'll try to write a short description of "Rodney's UUCP modules".
Cos I just made rmail handle domain-routing and the rest of these
routing-algorithms right, I won't spend more than an hour for it.
I'm listening to Dire Strait's "Brothers in arms" and am very tired.
Hmm, now that I'm talking about myself: I'm 18 years old, so just call
me "Rod" - (not "Mr. Volz" or some similar strange things) if you phone
me or write postcard to me. Thankya.

My english is not very well. Don't blame me, blame my english-teacher
(the ones who know me personally, probably know what I'm talking
about). What I wanna say: don't expect me to fullfill wonders!

Let's begin.

"Mercury UUCP" (how I first called the stuff) or "Rodney's UUCP
Modules" which is the current name,  has it's origin in the fact that
there was no mail- and news-handling package for the ST, when I got
fascinated by usenet and mail and all. Once when I talked to a friend
who told me about the exciting world of usenet, I decided to write on
my own what I was looking for. Guess that was a mistake. :-) Mercury is
(except uucico) written in K&R C - without indecent things such as
prototype declarations.

Mercury UUCP is shareware, so I'd appreciate to see my bank account
raise a bit sometimes. I had to call Aragon, Delos and other sites here
in germany many times to test uucico, and that made my phone charges go
higher and higher.

See the file "README" for further information; thank you.

For it may be complicated to remit money from other countries to
germany, I'll tell you my adress. It would also be nice of you guys out
there, if some people who perhaps can't pay the money for some reason
would send me at least a picture postcard. I'm always interested in how
much people use the stuff.

my address is:

Rodney Volz
Klugestrasse 12
7000 Stuttgart 1

my international phone number is: +49 711 651864

In the US for example you'd have to dial "01149 711 651864". Within
germany, just dial "0711 651864". Feel free to call me any time you
want. At night I might be sleeping and have disabled the phone ringer.
But don't worry...


Concept of Mercury UUCP
-----------------------

All files, as there are mail messages and news articles, are first
placed into something called "mailqueue". Then, other programs pick
them up and put them where they belong to.

All main configuration data is put in a file named "config.sys". This
file has to be put in the folder "\etc" or "\mercury" of drive C, D, E
or A. The best idea is to put it in the \etc folder of the partition
you run Mercury UUCP from. Now, I'll show you my config-file, and try
to tell ya after each line, what it means.


0001 "D:"				# System-drive

That's the name of the partition where you wanna put Mercury UUCP.
Don't append a backslash at the end of the drive id; just use
"D:" or "A:" or something like that.


0002 "merkur"				# Sitename

The name you wanna call your host.


0003 "HD Crashtest Center"		# Organisation

Your organization line. If you dunno what to put in here,
just leave it as it is.


0004 ".gtc.de"				# Domain

Important! Here you should put the name of your domain. For
example, if uunet should come to use an ST someday, they
would have to insert ".uu.net" here. If you dunno what to
write in here, insert ".UUCP".


0005 "D:\usr\adm"			# Logfile-Directory

A directory, where our log-files go to. Create it on your
Merucry-partition, and insert it's name her.


0006 "postmaster"			# Postmaster-Account.

Every unix-machine should have a postmaster who's reliable for
mailing problems. Choose a name for him here (or leave it
unchanged).


0007 "D:\bin.uu\uucico.prg"		# uucico

uupoll has got to know, where to find uucico.prg. Tell it, and don't
forget the extension!


0008 "D:\usr\bin\c16.ttp"		# Compress

Rnews and batch will be looking for Mercury's 16bit-compress. Insert
it's name with full path and extension here.


0009 "D:\etc\passwd"			# Password-File

The password-file. Ya know /etc/passwd on unix-machines? Something made
me think it would be the best idea to have an equivalent to it. Look
into my passwd-file, and try to understand it (shouldn't be difficult).
Ahm, by the way: the one you have entitled to be your postmaster has to
have an entry ("account") in here!


0010 "2"				# Redial-counter for uucico

How many times do you want uucico to redial, if the remote host should
be busy? A value of 2 will result in a max. of three attempts: first
call, and two re-trys.


0011 "D:\bin.uu\mail.prg"		# Mailer

Location of "mail.prg". Don't try to insert "elm" here, it won't
cause anything but trouble.


0012 "D:\usr\lib\news\active"		# Active-file for newsgroups

This file determines, which newsgroups to accept, and which
to send to "junk". If you don't come along with creating
an aproppriate active-file, just leave it away.


0013 "D:\usr\lib\news\sys"		# Sys-File

Here you have to determine, which host you want to give which
news, and how you want to compress the news.

delos:comp,rec,alt,!alt.flame:c13

...means: your host will spool comp, rec and alt (except alt.sex)
to delos, and will compress with 13 bit.

Another example:

delos:all:c16

will grant a full news-feed to delos, and will run compress with full
16 bit. If you put a percent-sign before a newsgroup's name, only
locally posted articles will be spooled to the concerned host. Example:
"delos:%all:c16". The sys-file may contain empty lines and remarks. The
latter ones have to be preceeded by a "#". If an entry for a system is
becoming too long, just break it into two or more lines with a backslash:

delos:rec.arts.poems,alt.cyberspace,dnet.general,foo.bar.useless,\
comp.sys.trarari.st:c16


0014 "D:\usr\spool\mqueue"		# Mailqueue

The mail-queue-directory I talked about in the above. It's
a directory, you have to create.


0015 "D:\etc\hosts"			# Host-File

Hmm, another one of this non-standard-but-complicated files.

This is a part of my hosts-file:

delos|atx4b0e0|ANY|2400|7288526|ogin:|uumerkur|ssword:|foobar|D:\usr\spool\uucp\delos
aragon|atx4b0e0|ANY|2400|0703136724|ogin:|umerkur|ssword:|foobar|D:\usr\spool\uucp\aragon

The meaning of the fields is:

- Name of the host you wanna call
- Modem init string. Just leave it as it is!
- Time to call. A value like "18:27" will cause uucico to wait until
  18:27 before calling a system. "ANY" should be reasonable.
- Baudrate
- The phone number of the host you wanna call. If you use
  touch-tone dialing, feel free to start the number with a "t". ;-)
- A string we expect, before sending the next field's content.
- Login name
- A second string we expect, before sending next field's content.
- our password for the remote host
- The spooldirectory for our remote host. You'll have to create
  a spooldirectory for every host you want to call.

That's it! Ahm, yeah: the hosts file may only contain up to 20 lines.


0016 ""					# Reserved for future use

Currently unused.


0017 "aragon"				# General relay host

Here you should have to insert the name of a host called by you,
which you consider to be a good mail router. Rmail will send
your mail messages to this host, if it doesn't know how to
route 'em.


0018 "E:\news"				# News-Directory

In this directory (which you have to create) rnews will create (itself
- wow!) a file- and directory-structure similar to to /usr/spool/news
on unix-systems running news211.


0019 "D:\usr\lib\mail\mydomain"		# File discribing our domain(s)

This (mandatory) file has to contain the name of the domain
you belong to. If you belong to more than one domain, your domain-file
may look like:

.uu.net
.chi.il.us
.edu
.nasa.cia.kgb.mil.gov


0020 "D:\bin\me.prg"			# Default-Editor

Your favourite text editor. I use Micro-Emacs.


0021 "D:\usr\tmp"			# Temp-Directory

We need a directory where we can put our trash...


0022 "D:\usr\lib\mail\paths"		# Paths-file for rmail

Rmail uses this (unix-compatible) file to find a fast path to a target
host. You should create this file using "pathalias" on a unix system.

pathalias -l [your_hostname] <map_data >paths

...should work. But be careful: It's better to leave away the
paths-file, than using an old - or worse - a wrong one.


0023 "D:\bin\des.prg"			# Data encryption standard

Thanks to Phil Karn; Ka9q for his DES program. We use it to
en- and decrypt our secret messages.


0024 "D:\bin\uuenc.prg"			# 8-Bit -> 7-Bit

uuencode-program. Please *don't* use another uuencode or
uudecode, because ELM and mail expect them to provide
certain special features.


0025 "D:\bin\uudec.prg"			# 7-Bit -> 8-Bit

See last entry for comments.


0026 "D:\bin.uu\pnews.prg"		# Postnews

Insert path, name and extension of rnews here.


0027 "server"				# Name of server-User

Gotcha! Mercury UUCP provides a archive-server-function. Insert the
name of the user you want to entitle as server here. Common names are
"server" or "archive-server". This user has to have a home-directory
and an entry in the password-file.


0028 "D:\guests\server\stuff"		# Server-Directory

You should create this directory, and insert it's name here. The server
accepts only one real command, which is "send". Aliases for this command
are "mail", "get" and some others which I don't remember anymore.

The program server.prg searches in the home-directory of the user who
acts as server (Field 0027) for mail-files, and scans the message-body
for requests. If it can find a requested file, it'll just take it, and
mail it to the sender of the request-message. Server.prg doesn't
perform any 8-bit->7-bit-transformation, so you are recommended to put
only files to the stuff-directory, which are "mailable" without changes.

                            ---------

Okay, that's all about config.sys! Another possibility to set up
Mercury UUCP, is using environment variables. The names of these
variables are shown below; they're listed with the number of the
corresponding entry in config.sys. Using environment variables saves
startup time when running Mercury UUCP, because the programs don't have
to read config.sys each time when started.

		0001 # DRIVE
		0002 # SITENAME
		0003 # ORGA
		0004 # DOMAIN
		0005 # LOGDIR
		0006 # POSTMASTER
		0007 # UUCICO
		0008 # COMPRESS
		0009 # PASSWD
		0010 # REDIAL
		0011 # MAILER
		0012 # ACTIVE
		0013 # SYSFILE
		0014 # MAILQ
		0015 # HOSTS
		0016 # SPOOLDIR
		0017 # RELAY
		0018 # NEWSDIR
		0019 # DOMAINFILE
		0020 # EDITOR
		0021 # TEMP
		0022 # PATHSFILE
		0023 # DES
		0024 # UUENC
		0025 # UUDEC
		0026 # PNEWS
		0027 # SERVER
		0028 # SERVDIR

Note that the environment system is case sensitive! Mercury UUCP will
only recognize environment variables, if they are typed as shown above:
"TEMP=D:\tmp" is valid, "temp=D:\tmp" is not.

There are some further env. variables: QUIET and STRATEGY, which can be
omitted, if you don't need them. If you set QUIET to "True", "On" or
"1", Mercury UUCP will run more silent. STRATEGY defines the
routing-strategy used by Rmail. Valid modes are:

SMART		Default value. Rmail leaves bang paths as they are, and
		tries to resolve smart adresses to bangs.

REROUTING	Rmail reroutes all kinds of adresses.

RELAY		If STRATEGY is set to "RELAY", Rmail doesn't bother
		looking at the adress. Messages are simply forwarded to
		the "General relay host" (entry #17 in config.sys),
		who has to be enough "intelligent" to process them.
		Note that you don't need a paths-file, if you
		use RELAY routing.


I assume you've managed to install the stuff properly now (strange
assumption, ha?). Further, I assume you are using GULAM or a similar
command-line-interpreter. Now you need to tell Mercury UUCP, which user
is "currently logged on". Do this, by typing "login root", or "login
johnny" or whatever you've chosen to be your user-name. Login.prg will
create a file "\etc\current.usr" with the current user's data.

Create a file "signatur.mai" and a file "signatur.net" in your
home-directory. signatur.net will be appended to postings, signatur.mai
to mails.

Now, you're ready to send me a mail!

type "elm rodney@merkur.gtc.de"... And hope it'll work!

                           ---------

Alright. You've written your mail, but now you want it to be
piped to your remote host. It's a good idea to have a shell-script
which performs all necessary actions. For GULAM, you could use the
following one:

server
rmail
rnews
batch $1
uupoll $1
rmail
rnews

If you call this script with "poll uunet", it'll execute server,
rmail and rnews. Then it'll execute "batch uunet", and batch all news
articles which are to be spooled to uunet. "uupoll uunet" calls uucico
with the necessary parameters. Never call uucico directly!! After
the call is completed, the script will run rmail and rnews again, so
the received mail-messages and news-articles will be delivered.

If leave out one of the above commands, either your mail and your
postings won't leave your machine, (n)or incoming mail and news will
reach you.

I'll include the source code of uucico, too, because it's a hacked-up
version of the uucico that came with "mailtruk" from John Logajan.
Thank you very much, John! Our uucico now can even be called by other
hosts - but don't ask me how to do this, ask jan@janhh.sub.org. Also,
the version of Jan and Carsten seem to contain still bugs, so I'll
include the source of my uucico, too.

Other programs:

rn             -        read news
showmail       -        show, which users have mail
statnews       -        Give a statistic of newsgroups
expire n       -        delete news articles execept the ones
                        of the last n days


If there should be further problems, try to read the german
documentation (mercury.doc), or just gimme a call.
