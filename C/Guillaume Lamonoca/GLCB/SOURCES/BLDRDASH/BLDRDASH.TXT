Boulder-dash (v1.2) - Collect diamonds, kill monsters,  close  in
blob etc. etc.

Boulder-dash is a game very old indeed (originally a similar game
with  the same  name ran on  CBM64). The  goal in is to collect a
certain number of diamonds per level and then enter the next lev-
el by moving to the blinking exit-field, thus  incrementing  your
number of lives. A diamond is  worth points. Normally  extra dia-
monds are  worth more. When  playing the following  keyboard keys
may be used:
SPACE           -               in combination with arrows:steal
left arrow      -               move left
right arrow     -               move right
up arrow        -               move up
down arrow      -               move down
h               -               help 
In addition, some other  control key  combinations can  be  used:
Q               -               kill the game
I               -               restart level

Levels are stored in ASCII files. The first  line  in  a
level  file  contains  level  specific  parameters that should be
edited by hand. The parameters are:

height width speed diamonds-required diamonds-points extra-diamonds-points
blob-brake tinkle-dur time level-name

Where blob-brake  indicates  how  strongly  blob  propagation  is
slowed  down.   tink-dur is the time tinkle-walls will keep their
magic power. time is the time permitted to complete this level. 
level-name is the name of the level.
