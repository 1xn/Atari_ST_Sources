
     NOTE

     This is a horrible program.  Do not take it as an example of a
properly written GEM program or STiK program.  However it DOES show
how to access STiK and use a GEM interface, so it might be of use to
a programmer wanting to know how STiK operates.

     Are there bugs... YES
     Could it be written better... YES

     But isn't that what most example code is really ;)

     If someone feels like taking this code and rewritting forecast.  Go
ahead.  There is alot more info stored at the site than what is currently
being used.  You can use the port and address contained in the program and
Telnet in and use the menu system to get an idea of what else could be
done.

     So basically here is some code to a STiK application.  Hopefully it
will be usefull to someone. :)  I hope this is somewhat more helpful, than
the old SMTP code (which by the way I never got a copy of til after I wrote
my own :/ )  And I'm fairly certain that it will be more useful that the
old IRC kludge of STeve's (great credit should go to those that were able
to decipher it's cryptic meanings)  I would have liked to have done alot
better dev kit for the beginner, unfortunately I don't have the time, so
I've sluffed this off on you. :)
 
     Oh there was still being work done when this project fell into the
cracks, so I know there is at least some code and info in the RSC that
isn't in the release version.  So don't be suprised.
