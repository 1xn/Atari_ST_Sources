                   in Cooperation with Anthill Industries


     A Tool for getting the current weather conditions for almost any
major city in North America.

Requirements:

     STiK must be installed, enabled and connected to use Forecast.
     Forecast should work in any planar video mode (2,4,16,256 colors)
     It does not work in 16bit color mode. (High Color Mode on the F030)
     A resolution higher that ST Low is also recommended, but not required.

Archive Contents:

     CITIES.TXT     -  A list of three letter city codes for the U.S.
     FORECAST.DOC   -  This file.
     FORECAST.PRG   -  The Forecast program.
     FORECAST.RSC   -  The Forecast resource file.

Use:

     FORECAST utilizes the weather server system available in North
America.  As far as we know, Europe does not use this system.  If anyone
has information to the contrary of this please let us know and we will
include support for europe in a future version.

     **** We are trying to work out a good way to get world weather data
               at the moment.  With luck maybe soon ****

     To get weather for your city (in North America) or any other major
city in North America, press 'Control O'.  This brings up the open dialog,
now hit the 'Esc' key to clear the info line (if necessary) and enter in
the three letter code (from CITIES.TXT) for city you want the
weather for. A few example codes are 'CMH' for Columbus Ohio and 'LAX' for
Los Angeles California.  

     If the city code is valid, then the window will update to show temp
(fahrenheit), barometer, wind speed and humidity.  This information is both
displayed graphically and in text (at the bottom of the window).

     FORECAST always remembers the last city you for which you requested
the weather.  It saves this info in the 'FORECAST.PRF' file.  The user
never needs to do anything with this file, FORECAST handles it's
management.  So when ever you use FORECAST the last city you requested,
will be in the open dialog, if this is the city you want the info for then
just hit return.

     To exit the program either click the closer on the window, select
'Quit' from the 'File' menu or press the 'Control Q' keys.

Hot Keys:

     'Tab'           -  Brings up the about box.
     'Control O'     -  Brings up the Open box.
     'Help'          -  Brings up the Help box.

Possible Problems:

     On some systems, when you select 'Help' the program crashes.  We
haven't figured this one out yet.  Since it works fine on other system
which are comparably the same.  So if this happens to you, hopefully we
will get it fixed in the future, but this seems to be the only bug in
operation.

History:

     v.0.3 -   Initial Public Release
     v.0.4 -   Fixed Menu problems
               Removed SIZER for the moment
