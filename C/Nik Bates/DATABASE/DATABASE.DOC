Database Source
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Before I can convert Personal Accountant  into  C,  and GEM, I must first
experiment with Dialogue Boxes. I  have  therefore  decided to attempt to
write an address database program that  can  also be used to store Ictari
Members on. This progress of this  database  will hopefully be shown each
month, highlighting any  problems  I  had  or  have,  and solutions where
possible.

The first stage of this Database is  to create a working resource file to
use. I used WERCS to do  this  and  all  the files produced by WERCS have
been included. I then attempted to use C to manipulate the resource.

My first problem, which I  have  yet  to  solve  is  with WERCS itself. I
cannot for some reason get  the  ftext  boxes  to start at the beggining.
Load the example program in the  Database  folder  to see what I mean. In
this example you have to backspace in order to type anything in, or press
escape. There must be a way so that  the cursor is at the beginning, this
minor problem is really cracking me up,  so I would appreciate anyone who
can help. My WERCS came as a package and the manual is included, but very
brief and useless.

The actual program does very little.  It  will  load up the resource file
perfectly ok. It will  also  display  the  first  dialogue  box. Only two
options are enabled on this dialogue box.  These are Add Record and Quit.
Quit exits to the desktop.

Edit Record just does the  same  as  Add  record  at the moment. Add/Edit
record closes the dialogue box, and brings  up  a second one. This is the
dialogue box with all  the  troublesome  FTEXT's, mentioned above. Anyway
here you can enter the  data,  but  at  the  moment  the data will not be
saved, stored, or anything. Like I  said  earlier, not much has been done
with this project yet.

The source code is included at  least  shows  how to load a dialogue box,
work with it, and close it. Also  shows  how  to load a resource file and
free the space afterwards.

The next stage,  is  to  define  the  necessary  structures  so  that the
information obtained from the dialogue  can  be  stored. After this I can
use the fwrite command to save the records as they are entered.

In the meantime, if there  is  anything  you  don't understand about this
source, or if you have  any  queries,  tips,  advice, criticism, etc then
please get in touch.
