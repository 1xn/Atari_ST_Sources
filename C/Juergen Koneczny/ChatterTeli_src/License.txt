Chatter & Teli Source Code
==========================
Copyright (c) 1996-2006 by Juergen Koneczny

The development of Chatter & Teli is finished. Of course there are things
that would be nice to have or there are some bugs, but I simply do not have
enough time to implement them. So, if you are missing a feature or you want
a bug fix, you can do it yourself now.

If you create a new Chatter or Teli version, please do not distribute it
under my name. Still, all Chatter and/or Teli distributions must have the
copyright notice "Chatter copyright (c) 1996-2006 by Juergen Koneczny" and/or
"Teli copyright (c) 1996-2006 by Juergen Koneczny". Your additions must be
free of copyright, or the owner of the copyright must have granted the
release of the source code and the free distribution of the compiled version.

The source code is provided "as is" without any warranty.
