Hello,

before I released the sources written by Sven Kopacz, I had an look at the source code...

ASH Emailer requires IConnect. (Is there any IConnect emulator for MiNT around ?)

And it also requires an AES that:

- Supports MagiC Threads (I only know one: MagiC ;-))
- Supports AES function calls inside of USERDEF callbacks (I believe XaAES doesn't support that, but maybe it's just an stack size problem)

So... stop playing around, it won't run under MiNT without modifcations.

The code modifications to use ASH EMailer under MiNT can be done, for sure.It requires 3 steps:

- Replace IConnect Network Calls with MiNT Network calls...
- Rewrite the network routine, which uses Threads to non-blocking IO...
- Make sure that USERDEF's don't do harm.
