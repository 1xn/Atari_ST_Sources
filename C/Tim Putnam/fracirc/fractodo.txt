FracIRC Bug list 
================

. When cursor is over the edge of the screen, we have to go down a line (be careful
not to confuse this with the letter wrap function).
. DCC :)
. Channels and leaving and stuff like that still has problems.. needs 
a closer look
. File saving is cocked
. For windows, save position and a value to say if they're open or 
not. When reloading I want to reload not just the ones that are open 
but the ones without position as well.. That way the windows can be 
reopened to the same position as if on the desktop.
. Scrolling not working full stop.


FracIRC To Do List
==================

. Add a channel list section on the right edge of the window (this can be optional)
  . Have a popup selection to allow whois, whowas, query etc.
. Add a whois dialog, optional.
. Add a toolbox dialog (optional).
