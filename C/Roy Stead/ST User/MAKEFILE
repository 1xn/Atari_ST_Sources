# makefile for Othello program

# Created:  18/2/93 by RS

# If you own a MAKE program then this file can be used to assist you in
# compiling and linking your code. See the documentation for your MAKE
# program for details. Note that hash (#) marks the start of a comment.

# Pre-processor symbols:
#
#	DEBUG used to compile debugging code in do_move.c
#

# Compiler flags to use when compiling this program
CFLAGS = -O
#CFLAGS = -DDEBUG


# C libraries to link with this code
# dlibs.a is the Sozobon standard ANSI & Unix C libraries.
# These libraries are built in to Hisoft C, and may have a different name
# for your compiler. Lattice C's, for example, is called clib.bin
#
LIBS = dlibs.a

# The object code files which are to be linked together to form our Othello
# program. Each .o file is derived from a .c file. A common mistake when
# constructing makefiles is to list the source code files (*.c) here instead
# of the object code files (*.o)
#
OBJ = computer.o do_move.o graph.o human.o init.o main.o toolkit.o 


# Creation of othello.prg program depends on all object files.
#
othello.prg: $(OBJ)
	$(CC) -o $@ $(OBJ) $(LIBS)

# If othello.h is altered, recompile everything
#
$(OBJ): othello.h
