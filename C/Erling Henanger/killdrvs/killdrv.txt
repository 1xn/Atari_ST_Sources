This program can be used to tell tos that certain drives do not exist
(even if they do).
Also the opposite can be done, tell tos that drives exist, even if they 
don't.

I use this program to tell TOS not to bother about my minix-partitions.

USAGE:
        killdrv -c      : will disable drive C:.
        killdrv +q      : will enable  drive Q:.
        killdrv -cde    : will disable drive C: D: and E:.
        
        etc.
        
If no parameters are given to the program, it will start to look for
the file KILLDRV.INF in the root directory.
This file should contain the same parameters as specified from a SHELL.

example:

-de
[EOF]
        should kill drive D: and drive E:.
        
Be sure that there are no leading spaces before the -/+ sign.

That's it. It works fine for me, so I thought maybe someone else
could use it too.

Oh - and rename to killdrv.prg to put it in the auto folder.
src is supplied.

Do whatever you want with it.
