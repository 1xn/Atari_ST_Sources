** These are rough figures but it gives you an idea on the
   speed/efficiency of one implementation vs another

These results are from doing a 32 bit long int multiplication
of two numbers ONE MILLION TIMES.

Multiplying 2 long ints using Laser C's '*'           ===> 1:35
 
Multiplying 2 long ints using my In-line assembly     ===> 45 sec

Multiplying 2 long ints using modified In-line        ===> 37 sec 
assembly( i.e only send one value to the assembly
function, this function contains a PRECOMPUTED
sin or cos value that it multiplies by)
