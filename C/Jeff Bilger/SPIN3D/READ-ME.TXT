read-me for:===>   3d spin
--------------------------


Here's some code I whipped up tonight, it's for anyone who 
wants to understand basic 3d graphics. The archive consists 
of 4 'C' programs called SPIN4,...,SPIN7.C

Of course you can do double buffering to get rid of the flicker,
etc. 


      hope it helps...
