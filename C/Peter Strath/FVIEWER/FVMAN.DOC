1.    INTRODUCTION
=========================================================================
 
1.1 Main features
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
There are 4 main features to File Viewer;
  1) A file list to navigate through.
  2) Viewing text and picture files in a window.
  3) A feature called Extended File Information(EFI) enables you to give
     files a descriptive name of upto 32 characters and to associate a
     program to run and load that file.
  4) Searching file list and text files for specified text.

1.2 Using File Viewer
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
To run File Viewer just double click on "FV.PRG" from the Desktop or, if
your Desktop supports it, drag'n'drop a file/s onto its icon.

This program is designed to run on any TOS/GEM compatible computer in any
resolution with a minimum of 512k RAM.

The right mouse button is used in the file list to display information on
a particular file, and to enable the editing of its Extended File Info.

4.    FILE LIST
=========================================================================

4.1 Navigating
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
Moving through the file list is done by the use of single clicking the
left mouse button on the folder in the current list you wish to go to.

A folder is identified by having a '' character prefix.

To change to another drive a list of the current drives is located above
the root directories of any drive and is accessed by moving up the
directory tree.

You move up the directory by selecting the ".." entry (Previous
Directory) or press the file lists' window closer.

If the directory contents have changed then pressing the "." entry
(Re-read directory) will update the display.

4.2 Opening files
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
The mouse is used to open a file entry simply by clicking once on the
entry.

Files types supported;
  Folder/drive          - change current path to new one,
  *.IMG                 - loaded as GEM bitmap image (mono images only),
  *.PRG,TTP,TOS,APP,GTP - run as program,
  *.*                   - all other files are loaded as text files.



5.    EXTENDED FILE INFOMATION (EFI)
=========================================================================
                    --- Chapter under construction. ---



6.    BETA RELEASE 1 INFORMATION
=========================================================================

6.1 Hardware and software tested with.
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
520STFM with 4Mb RAM, in ST high, medium and low resolutions.
TOS v1.4, v1.0 and MagiC v2.01.

Limits tested to (designed to work with unlimited numbers);
  * Maximum number of windows opened(mixture of text and image windows);
     62 in MagiC OS,
     7  in TOS 1.0,
     7  in TOS 1.4,
     39 in TOS 1.4 using WiNX.
   
  * Smallest & largest files opened;
     Text file;
              0 byte,
        782,079 bytes
     GEM bitmap (*.IMG)
         18x 12 pixels,
       1600x800 pixels
  
  * 200+ EFI entries.


6.2 Known limits and bugs
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
Limits;

* A long name assigned to a DOS file name will be displayed for any file
  with the same DOS name.
  eg;
    If you add a long name "GEM Desktop Info" while in C:\ for
    DESKTOP.INF then any file called DESKTOP.INF in any directory will
    appear in the file list as "GEM Desktop Info".
* Long file names limited to 32 characters.
* The character '{' and '}' should not be used in a long file name as
  they are used to signify an associated program.
* No wildcards used in searches.
* Searches do not identify whole words, so searching for "he" will be
  successful on;
  "he", "her", "here", "the", "there", etc...

Bugs;

* The 25th opened window displays nothing. Any windows opened below or
  above this number seem to work as normal. Mostly harmless.
* If an error occurs during the loading of a GEM bitmap image quit
  the program immediately, as continuing would eventually lead to a
  crash. Fatal.
* Starting a search in the drive list will search all drives including
  drive B even if there isn't one. Harmless.
