This utility copies all files with VFAT coded names from
A: to the current directory. 

It is advisable to use a partition with long filenames
ie minix or similar as a target since otherwise portions
of the filenames and even directory tree might be truncated.

WARNING: Use this software with caution. I take no responsibility
for lost data or damage done by either faulty or proper usage of
this tool. It is in betatest stage.
