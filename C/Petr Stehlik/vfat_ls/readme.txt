Hi,

this is a little utility, similar to 'ls' or 'dir' commands. However this vls
list long file names stored on VFAT medias (Windows95/NT storing format).

Just start vls without parameters - it will print brief help.

Some examples of use:

vls a:                         list files on floppy from Windows
vls f:/www/lux                 list files stored on an EZ cartridge (provided
                               you've got an EZ-flyer :-)

OK. This software is freeware, of course. It's based on Sven's code, anyway.

If you need to copy files in a more comfortable way, download VFATCP (it's on
my WWW page - see below).

Enjoy!
