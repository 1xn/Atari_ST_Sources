Graph.c is a program that accesses some of the basic shapes in VDI. The C
program gives explicit ways to  call  the generalized drawing primitives.
Click the mouse to go to  the  next drawing primitive. The primitives use
default attribute functions which means black  and white are your colors.
Graph.c should be run in medium resolution mode. Run the program to get a
feel for these primitives.

To  increase  the  flexibility  of  these  functions  VDI  has  attribute
functions to change certain  features  of  the drawing primitives. First,
the primitives have to be separated into those using fill area attributes
and those using line attributes as follows:

        fill area attributes                    line attributes

        v_bar(,)                                v_arc(,,,,,)
        v_pieslice(,,,,,)                       v_circle(,,,)
        v_ellarc(,,,,,,)                        v_ellpie(,,,,,,)
        v_rbox(,)                               v_ellipse(,,,,)
        v_rfbox(,)

The low resolution has 16 colors  and  the medium resolution has 4 colors
to choose from. To change a standard color  in  the ST all you have to do
is call vs_color(,,) with an array of values.

index = 5;
rgb[0] = 200;   /* sets red color to 20%, min is 0, max is 1000 */
rgb[1] = 1000;  /* sets green color to100%, min is 0, max is 1000 */
rgb[2] = 0;     /* sets blue color to 0%, min is 0, max is 1000 */
vs_color( handle, index, rgb );  /* '5' now denotes above color when */
                                 /* used for a color index          */

This will allow a range of  512 (7*7*7) different colors.  The resolution
for the colors is 7 for each primary color. The standard color set always
starts with white and then black for color indexes of '0' and '1'.


Some of the fill area attributes are:

vsf_color( handle, color ); /* color is color index number for */
                            /* subsequent fill operations      */

Some of the line attributes are:

vsl_type( handle, style );  /* style=1 is solid, style=3 is dot */
                            /* There are 6 different styles     */
vsl_width( handle, width ); /* width is the width of the lines in */
                            /* odd numbers                        */
vsl_color( handle, color ); /* color is color index number for */
                            /* subsequent polyline operations  */
