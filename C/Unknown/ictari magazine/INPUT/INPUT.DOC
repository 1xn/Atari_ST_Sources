The function  Bconin(2)  returns  a  long  value  from  the  keyboard. In
standard C input from the keyboard usually takes the form

                             int c;
                             c = getchar();

This allows c to be a  character  as  represented  by its ASCII code or a
control character which has a negative number.  If  c was defined to be a
char then  it  could  only  represent  an  8  bit  unsigned  number.  The
important control character is <ctrl-z>  which  equals  -1.  This  is the
standard form to define end of file.   A  header file will usually have a
definition such as -

                             #define EOF -1

so where EOF is the compiler will replace it with -1.

The same thinking  is  involved   with  Bconin.   Not  only  can you read
characters but function keys and combinations of keys from the key-board.
A header file or program  will have  to be set  up with the following:-

                            extern long bios();
                    #define Bconin(a)   bios(2,a)

Bconin(a) then is defined in terms  of bios() which  is defined elsewhere
(extern) and returns a long integer.

Compile and then link to AESBIND along  with the other files you normally
link to.
