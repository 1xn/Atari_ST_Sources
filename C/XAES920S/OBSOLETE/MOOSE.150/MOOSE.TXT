*** Moose 1.4.3 ***********************************************************

This version of Moose is rather good :). It now supports the setting of
the double click time... It also has a revamped command interpreter and
a slightly modified data structure for the button packets. I have also
added loads of comments and reorganised the source code into a set of
smaller, more easily digested files.

The MOOSE.XDD file should be placed in your MINT directory on your boot
drive. Don't worry about leaving it there even when you're not using
XaAES as it doesn't do anything except occupy memory, unless some
program tells it to.

The traditional MOUSESRV.TOS file is included although it doesn't do
much. I have only included it so that you can use the latest MOOSE.XDD
with 'old' versions of XaAES (beta <=4 - hopefully beta 5 won't need the
MOUSESRV :).

All the techie info has moved into a seperate file. That file is aimed
at anyone who is interested in using the Moose, not just XaAES. That way,
people can use Moose to create their own graphical OS's. That file is
complete in the sense that everything in it will work, but there is still
an awfull lot to do with Moose.

The next big thing is rectangle events - watching for the mouse entering
or leaving various rectangles. However, it occured to me the other day
that the Moose could also send a report saying 'activate the screen
saver - the user is doing bugger all'.

Also, the Moose could act as a mouse accelerator. This would be
configured via a seperate GEM application. What do you think? I would like
to hear any suggestions for various acceleration methods if you have them.

Cheers,
