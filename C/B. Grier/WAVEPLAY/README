WAVEPLAYER.PRG/TTP are provided to demonstrate
how to use the DMA sound hardware of the STE
and TT computers.

The source code provided is not public domain.
It has been provided to allow you to understand
how a Microsoft Corporation WAVE file is defined
and what is needed to play these files on Atari
computers.

You may incorporate parts of this code in your
own programs providing you acknowledge the source
of those routines via either 1) a comment at the
beginning of the module that contains the code,
or 2) an acknowledgement displayed at startup.

To use WAVEPLAYER drag a WAVe file to the WAVEPLAYER.
Alternately you may supply a file name as the first
argument on a command line Or you may run WAVEPLAYER
without any arguments, which will cause WAVEPLAYER to
accept the filenames from standard input. This allows
the following under the Mark Williams Shell:

            ls *.wav | waveplayer

WAVEPLAYER does not understand wildcard characters in
file names. So the following will produce undesired
results:
            waveplayer *.wav

Caveats:
  Waveplayer has not been tested with 8 bit stereo wave files.
  Waveplayer has not been tested with 16 bit wave files.

If you come across a WAVE file with one of these formats
and it does work please let me know.

Support:
  If you come across a WAVE file that does not work and it
  is on either GEnie or COMPUSERVE please mail the name of the
  file and the roundtable I can retrieve it from. If the file
  is one of your own please uuencode the file and mail it to
  me at either:

    B.GRIER        on GEnie
    bjgrier@bnr.ca on internet
