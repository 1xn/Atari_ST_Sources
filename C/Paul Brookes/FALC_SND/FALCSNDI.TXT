     FALCSNDI.C      Falcon Sound Demonstration Program
                          for ICTARI by Paul Brookes.

     Compile with Lattice C Version 5.6.

     Introduction
     ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
     Welcome!
     The best way to learn about the  Falcon  audio system is to connect it
     up to your Hi-Fi and experiment with this program.

     You will need, at the  very  least,  the  Modern Atari System Software
     book (which was free with Lattice C 5.6) and lots of patience.

     If you connect your CD-player to the  microphone inputs be sure to use
     an attenuating cable i.e. one  with approximately 220KOhm resistors in
     series with the Left and Right inputs:

     CD Left ---------[  R ]---------> Mic In Left
                       220K
     GND ----------------------------> GND

     CD Right --------[  R ]---------> Mic In Right
                       220K

     If you want help making a suitable cable then drop me line via ICTARI.

     Firstly an apology. This program has no structure. It was written as a
     test program to gain experience with the Falcon's DMA sound system. It
     uses only standard functions (osbind.h).

     Experiment with the Soundcmd function to alter the left and right gain
     and attenuation settings. The attenuation is set to maximum and may be
     reduced if required. e.g.  to  reduce  the  left  attenuation and thus
     increase the resolution of the  analogue  to  digital process, use the
     Soundcmd (left_attenuation,<value>) function  where  <value> is 0(min)
     to 240(max).

     Note: Attenuation specifies the input signal  level presented to the A
     to D convertor. Gain specifies the output signal level produced by the
     D to A convertor. The Attenuation  should  be  set so that the loudest
     sound signal input only  just  fails  to  cause distortion (clipping).
     This will ensure that the maximum  resolution and best signal to noise
     figure may be obtained. This is rather like the process of setting the
     recording level on a tape  recorder.  The  gain  is set to provide the
     correct signal matching  with  the  amplification  equipment  you have
     connected to  the  headphone  output.  Ideally  set  this  as  high as
     possible without overloading  the  input  of  your  amplifier. Use the
     volume control on your amplifier to  set  volume not the gain setting.
     This will give the  best  sound  quality  and  highest signal to noise
     ratio. If you are using  the  internal  speaker  then the gain becomes
     your volume control and any  trade-offs  in  sound quality will remain
     un-noticed!

     To change the sample rate,  set  the  Prescale value in the Devconnect
     function. Some values are not  valid  for  use  with the Crystal CODEC
     used in the Falcon. For the  25.175MHz  clock, the following values of
     Prescale are invalid: 6,8,10,12.

     Prescale = 1 gives the maximum sample rate of 49.17 KHz.
     Prescale = 11 gives the lowest rate of 8.195KHz.
     The sample rate is (25175000/256)/(Prescale+1).
     e.g. Prescale = 4, Sample rate = (98340)/5 = 19668Hz.

     Use the Buffptr function to  access  the  play  and record data buffer
     pointers.

     If you get stuck write to me via ICTARI.

     I've included quite a few comments to  make deciphering the code a bit
     easier. Unfortunately it looks a mess!  If you develop this code, then
     stick the #defines in a header  file.  If  you type in any more please
     send them to ICTARI so we can all use them.

     Good luck,

     Paul.
