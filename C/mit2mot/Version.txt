Version notes for mit2mot (these are more notes to myself than anything that
should be taken as gospel, btw  -sb):

5/31/93	    Version 1.0.0 released.

6/13/93	    Fixed several problems pointed out by William Rosenkrantz,
	    to wit:

	    - string literals containing escape sequences were not being
	      recognized as strings.

	    - gcc -S apparently generates labels of the form
	      gcc_compiled.: with periods in them.  I've extended the
	      tokenizer to recognize labels with periods at the end;
	      hopefully that will be enough.

	    - comments of the form #etc. were not being recognized.

	    Also expanded the grammar to include more GAS-legal syntax,
	    notably temporary labels and arithmetic operators.  Some of
	    the `020-only opcodes are still not recognized, since I
	    don't know the appropriate Motorola syntax to generate.

6/14/93	    Version 1.0.1 released

8/5/94	    Some bugs c/o Thorsten Roskowetz, to wit:

	    - In scanner.l:  use strtoul(0 instead of strtol() so that
	      constants larger than LONG_MAX don't get munged.

	    - In main():  exit(1) instead of returning normally if the
	      parser fails.

	    In scanner.l:  In fixing the gcc_compiled.: label bug above,
	    I added a few lines to change the trailing '.' to a '_';
	    unfortunately, I changed the wrong copy.

8/6/94	    Version 1.0.2 released
