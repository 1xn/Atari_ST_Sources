sprintf.slb
===========

This lib contains function sprintf(), identical as in C library...
or strictly speaking, it just contains the sprintf() function of the C
library, because it is just linked with that. Why so? Well, I must admit I
miss this function sometimes in my assembly programs.

Usage (assuming you *know* how to use the C sprintf()):

(exec)(slb, 0L, n, &dst, &tmp, long arg1, long arg2, ...);

where:

'n' is the number of arguments starting from (and including) the next
	one. Maximum of 18 arguments (including 16 variables) and 
	minimum of 2 (buffer and template alone) are possible.
'&dst' is the address of the memory buffer where the resulting string
	will be written to.
'&tmp' is the template string.
'argx' are long (!) arguments, up to sixteen.

See the test.s for details. The lib has been tested to run OK on both 
MiNT and MagiC, despite the differences in implementation.

PS: The lib has SMALLTPA bit set in the program header, keep this in 
    mind before recompiling. Under MiNT it does not matter so much 
    (the mem is shrunk anyways), but under MagiC it will hog all the 
    RAM, when the bit is cleared.

Have fun,
