This version of GNU Chess requires the regular GNU Chess code to be provided
as a library.  Currently, that library is specified by an absolute path in
the Makefile.  I'm sorry this is a little untidy, but I'm rushing this out,
as I've been sitting on it for ages.

So, to compile, you will need:

	1. The GNU Chess sources
	2. The GNU C++ compiler
	3. My GEM++ library

Contact me if you have any problems obtaining those items.
