This is GNU Chess 4.0, ported to C++, ported to the Atari ST/TT with a
GEM user interface (any resolution, windows, mouse, etc.)

This is version 0.9 of the GEM user interface.

DO NOT SPLIT UP THESE PROGRAMS.  Both the 512K and 2M versions should
be included in all packagings of this software.  So should the source files.

   gnuchess.prg  - 2M RAM

Tested (to some degree) on:

   8M TT + MultiTOS
   4M ST + Warp 9

If you have problems or suggestions, please let me know.  For suggestions,
realize that I am only responsible for the graphical front-end.  The GNUChess
main engine does not, for example, provide for human vs. human play, hence
neither does this front-end.

Hope you like it!
