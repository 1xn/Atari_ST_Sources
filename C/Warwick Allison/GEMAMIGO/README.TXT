                                     by Warwick Allison


This is the first public release of gemamigo a port of the X11 port of
the Amiga Go program AmiGo.

GEM AmiGo runs in any resolution, including HiColor and TrueColor, and
MIGHT work with just 512K.

The `readme' from the X11 distribution (xamigo) is included as README.X11
The `readme' from the original distribution is included as README.AMI

Sources are included.  To rebuild the game you'll need G++ and GEM++, so
don't lose the PRG if you don't have those!

Feel free to mail me any comments and suggestions for improvements, but
realize that I'm not really a Go player - I just did this port for you.

The .RSC file is very changeable.  RSC files in other languages would be
useful.  All buttons can be replaced by different object types, so if
you're really keen, Kanji buttons would be atari!  The IMG files can
be modified (even changed in size), so long as they are kept as
monochrome IMG files.
