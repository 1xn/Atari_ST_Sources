this is just something i wipped up one day. i don't remember ever seeing
a mono mandelbrot generator (i dislike color :-), so here goes...enjoy.

it uses line A to plot pixels. should be portable to any bitmap computer
(i.e. sun, apollo, sgi, amiga, mac, pc, X11, ...). i tried to make the
portability things seperated for relative ease. i plan on doing an
X11 port soon (on a cray-2, to get some SPEED). i'd like to be able to
generate and display an image every few seconds (network is the limiting
factor :^). yafttms (yet another fly thru the mandelbrot set)...i will 
also change the file to use the RLE-like scheme i mention somewhere...

in the spirit of a recent c.lang.c thread, the program uses some goto's!
included are some atari-specific line-A calls (like MWC libraries, i
think) which might be of general interest. written in alcyon as68.
i did not spend any time at all on the algorithm so expect 500+ second
runs. use "-i 50" for most everything (unless u run overnite). no
mouse support (you specify coord on command line).
