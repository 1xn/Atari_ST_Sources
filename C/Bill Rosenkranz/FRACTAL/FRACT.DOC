    fract [options]

    -i iterations (1000)     defines "convergence"
    -x xcenter (-1.0)        center of viewport
    -y ycenter (0.0)
    -r range (3.0)           size of viewport (width=height)
    -s scale (3)             0 to 3, 0=coarse 3=fine
    -v                       invert colors
    -a                       add contours
    -h                       hold screen before exit

    This is a monochrome  mandelbrot  generator.  It was originally written
    for Atari ST but should port  easily  to  Amiga, PC, MAC, SUN, and X11.
    All you really need is to be able  to address and color a pixel. It may
    work on colour (med rez, I have not tried it) but you will only get the
    top half of the image.

    It generates images in a square only. On the ST, this is 360x360 pixels
    or about 129,000 pixels. It can take a while to generate an image so it
    does it in  2  passes.  The  first  pass  is  very  coarse (45x45 "big"
    pixels). You can break out  of  the  calculation  at  any time with any
    keystroke. You can also dump the  binary  data  to a file (probably not
    portable for non-680x0 systems because of byte order of shorts).

    It works from a command line, you can set the iterations limit (default
    is 1000 - much to large for  most  hacking). try "-i 50" for most work.
    The default scaling is for finest  image  (single pixel), for a quicker
    scan, try "-s 2" (arg for -s is 0 to 3, 0 is coarse, 3 is fine).

    There are a couple of files to  play  with, these are binary data files
    and unarc to around 250kB each, they are  set up for the Atari ST using
    ffp floats. There are only 3 floats  stored  and they are only used for
    annotation so just skip them if you  like.  The files are in M0.ARC and
    M1.ARC. M0 is the full Mandelbrot set  and  M1  is a blowup of the area
    near the tangency of the 2 big circles in the set. Generate them with:-

    fract -o m0 -i 50
    fract -o m1 -i 50 -x -0.9 -y -0.3 -r 0.13

    Feel free to copy.  Leave  this  file  alone!  No other restrictions on
    copying or hacking. Use as you like.
