        The following files perform random selections for:
        
                a.) NeoDesk Pictures
                b.) DegaDesk Pictures
                c.) NewBell Digitized Sounds
                
        NRPS:
                The NeoDesk Random Picture Selector.  NRPS Looks for a
                file by the name of NRPS.INF in the boot root dir.  If
                this file is found, "USING NRPS.INF for paths..." will
                be printed and this file must contain:
                        Line 1: path including drive for pictures
                                (without concluding backslash)
                        Line 2: destination path for the picture
                If this file is not found, it defaults to my paths which
                are 1: E:\CLIPART and 2: C:\NEODESK
                
                NRPS then selects a pictrue based on medium or hi res
                and copies it (using the screen as a buffer) to the
                destination overwriting or creating the file.  This version
                has taken out the NEO option since I don't have any
                NeoChrome pictures.  (I think it was a NEO option in the
                old version... can't remember)
                
        DRPS:
                DegaDesk Random Picture Selector.  DRPS does the same as
                NRPS with the following changes:
                        1.) DRPS.INF is searched for
                        2.) Destination file is named DESKTOP.PI?
                        3.) Default paths are
                                        1: E:\CLIPART
                                        2: C:\AUTO\UNUSED

        NBRSS:
                NewBell Random Sound Selector.  Since NewBell allows only
                ten sounds in NEWBELL.DAT, NBRSS will search the path
                listed in the first file of NEWBELL.DAT, select a .SND
                file, and rewrite NEWBELL.DAT containing only that sound
                file.  If NEWBELL.DAT is non existant, it will default
                to C:\AUTO\SOUNDS\*.SND.  This provides the added feature
                that you will never have to update NEWBELL.DAT with the
                sound files you add.  NBRSS selects one at random from
                the folder, looking only for the .SND extension.
                
        NOTES:
                I do not use any .INF files for DRPS and NRPS, if there
                is a bug in these options (probably not), let me know
                before May '90 at cs325ec@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu or else configure
                your hard disks to match mine :-).
                
        Sources should be included in this archive.  These files are PD
        (boy how nice of me).  The C sources were compiled under TURBO C
        version 2.0 (an ansi compiler).
