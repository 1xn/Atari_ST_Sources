        V 1.0:
                Disk Map & One type of disk check.

        V 1.1
                Disk Map & Cumulative multiple pass checking added.

        V 2.0
                Coming as soon as I figure out a routine for reading
                physical sectors from hard disk beyond 32767.  I need
                to be able to write the boot sectors.  Partition is not
                enabled in V1.1.
Overview:
        SAM is a multipass cumulative sensitivity-adjustable disk
        analyzer.  By cumulative I mean that once clusters are marked
        as BAD they will stay bad unless you clear them.  Another pass
        will not decide that they are suddenly 'healed'.
Notes:
        SAM V1.1 is cheap shareware.  But it can be a life saver if
        like me you got hold of an MFM drive or just have a hard
        time with certain floppies.  If you want something in a hard
        disk utility, don't hesitate to contact me at (217)359-7483
        during the 89-90 school year or (011) 41-61-475146 thereafter.
        USENET: cs325ec@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu.  Drop a comment on some
        utility that is not DLII redundant and if I think it has
        merit, I'll hack it out.

The works:
        Disk Map:
                Provides a cluster map of the data clusters, performs
                a fat analysis upon reading of the information.
                
                Click on <- or -> to select a drive.
                Click on the drive letter to get its information.
                Click on up or down arrows to scan disk map.
                Enjoy the information.
        
        Analyze Media:
                Select drive as stated above.
                Clicking on clear:
                        Will clear all fats & directories or
                        all registered bad clusters from the fat
                        depending upon your answer to the dialog
                        box which pops up.
                Clicking on test: up or down
                        in V1.1 switches between ONE and PAS.
                                ONE: performs a cluster by cluster
                                        read, trapping errors and
                                        marking them in the fat.
                                PAS: performs sixteen passes, keeping
                                        track of a cluster's performance
                                        in sixteen block reads & writes
                                        and marks the cluster as bad
                                        if it's performance degrades
                                        to the sensitivity in Sens:.
                Clicking on analyze:
                        Starts the analysis.  NOTHING WILL BE WRITTEN TO
                        DISK UNLESS A:) The analysis completes on it's
                        own w/o being stopped by a key press. or B:)
                        in ONE checking, if you select WRITE WHAT HAS
                        BEEN DONE SO FAR, it will write the appropriate
                        clusters as bad which have already been found.
                        Analysis is cumulative.  If a disk is bad,
                        I suggest removing files.  Currently no check
                        is made.  FAT entries are set to DCAB or BDA
                        for hard disk & floppy respectively.  (These
                        spell out BADC for a hard disk and BA D for
                        a floppy).
