	Mutate is an extension of SAM (Spieu!'s Analyzer of Media) and
	will soon be a part of it as well as a comprehensive hard drive
	daily/weekly FAT & directory back up system.
	
	If you are interested in the latest version of SAM, send a letter
	or if you want the latest version, either $$$ or a SASE and disk
	to

	The backup system will save your FATs, main directory, and subs
	as you choose to either a file (on any disk), physical HD sectors
	or marked off partition sectors.  It resides in the AUTO folder
	and will do these backups automatically on a daily/weekly basis.
	
	The disk check system performs sensitivity adjustably passes on
	your hard disk in one of 16 combinations.  Using multiple pass,
	single (like ICD) or binary search for bad sectors (fastest).
	
	Mutate will also be incorporated into SAM and polished up.  In this
	version Find does not work.  I am releasing it mainly for people
	who need to edit sectors larger than 512 bytes.
