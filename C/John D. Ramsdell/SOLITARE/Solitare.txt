[[		saa - Streets and Alleys Solitaire

saa is an implementation of the solitaire game Streets and Alleys for
Posix compliant machines that also provide the curses terminal screen
handling and optimization package.  It is written in ANSI C, but in a
style that should allow its compilation by many non-ANSI C compilers.

Enjoy!
