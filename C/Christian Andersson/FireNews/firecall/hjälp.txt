Hello Christian!

Yes, sure it is always best to support both methodes. But by forcing users to 
run HSModem, they don't loose anything - only get a much better and stable 
RS-port. And HSModem doesn't take that much memory, so even a 512kb ST run fine 
with it.

Remap - as in setting the baud to 110 to get 38k4 (or was it 57k6?). Bconin/out 
us just to slow when you get into really fast speed. You are much better of by 
using Fopen, Fread etc - read/write large blocks of data over the serial ports.

Read the docs for HSModem 6 - it's in english too! There you will find a list 
of the speeds you get by using HSModem. I think setting baud to 110 gives 38k4 
and 134 gives 57k6. You set the speed using RS_Config. It differs from machine 
to machine, so you have to figure out what computer your program is running on.

 CA> First, does your Phone-company (Provider) have something called
 CA> Caller ID? ie, you get some information sent to you along wiht the
 CA> RING-signal, so that you can see (With the right equipment) who is
 CA> calling (The number) BEFORE you answer the phone?

Yeah, British Telecom provides this.. and I think you have to pay for it.

 CA> Second, Do you have an Modem that support Caller ID, ie an option in

Yep, I have a Supra 144LC.

 CA> How does your phone-company handle the user-part of the Caller id
 CA> service? Is it on constantly? or do you have to cal the company and
 CA> ask them to put it on?

It is on constantly once you have paid for it.

 CA> Do you have to pay to get this service? And How much does it cost?

I'm not sure if you have to pay... therfore i don't know how much it costs.

 CA> is there any ways of cancelling this service when you have it on?

I don't know.


 CA> how it all works with your company (not the tecnical, but the user-
 CA> side like the above questions) and do not forget to mention the name
 CA> of the phone-company.  :)

Err... if you have a phone with a caller-id digital display, it displays the 
incomming number.  If the caller wants to hide his number from you he can dial 
141 before he dials the rest of the number.

I am with British Telecom.

 CA> When do they send the information? Ex: Before the first RING-signal

It says in my modem manual that the information is sent between the first and 
second RING.  It doesn't mention that it comes at any other time.. :|

 CA> Name of the modem would be good now! :)

Supra 144LC.  (same commands as all other Supra Fax modems).

 CA> How do you switch on/off the detecting of the Caller-id signals?

The AT commands:

#CID=0 Disables caller ID
#CID=1 Enables Caller ID in formatted format
#CID=2 Enables Caller ID in unformatted format (ASCII printable
                                    characters in hex format)


 CA> Well, I guess thats it! :) I hope that you can answer this for me, so
 CA> that I can (hopefully) finnish my project soon.

Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.. but that is all I know :(

BT will soon be charging you to pay them money :)

And for the guy who wants the information...

The system [Caller ID] works by sending the caller's number encoded as a 
1200bps, FSK data stream inserted between the first and second rings to the 
called party. The data is in serial simplex, binary asynchronous format.

Taken from Electronics - The Maplin Magazine dated May 1992, News Page when the 
system was launched in America, and before BT new anything about it :)

Aha.. I know about 141/1471/14713 etc, but I hadn't realised that it was part 
of caller ID.  I thought it was separate because the 1471 feature just phones 
the exchange and reads stored data.... but Caller ID actually happens while the 
phone is ringing.  Surely these two feaures can't be as closely related as you 
say they are? :|

Also, I was sure that you had to pay for Caller ID.... something to do with œ4 
IIRC.  Could be œ4/month, or œ4/quarter.  I don't know which.. :|

 CA> Hmmm, Do you think you can do a little research for me? :))

Ask Spencer... he works for them :))

I would help... but BT are /really/ crap at giving you written details about 
their services.... I guess all their advertising money goes on the TV ads.

They send out a little booklet every 3 months detainly new BT services, but 
they fail to mention the old ones... and I have thrown all my older books away.

The same goes for the phone directory... mine is now 2.5 years out of date!!  
Think how many changes there must have been since the last edition! :(

It's not on really considering the amount of profit BT make each year.. :(


 >> Yep, I have a Supra 144LC.
 CA> This one supports the Caller ID from British Telecom?

Nope, it doesn't.

Someone said that it supports Mercury and Cable Caller ID features though... 
just not the non-standard BT one. :((


 CA> Yeah! but how do you pay for it? do you call the company and tell

Don't quote me on this, but I think it is œ4 a quarter at the moment. I have

So that 2 for and 2 against!!  Does anyone know the truth!?? ;-)

I wish!!  .. but as BT doesn't use the standard Caller ID format I have no way

Um... I will ring BT and ask for a leaflet on it.

Errmmm ... hang on a bit, Christian. Steve and I are in disagreement!!

I HAVE a modem which supports caller ID but it finds nothing on my incoming 
calls.

I also have some recent Brit. Telecom data which says it costs œ4 a quarter for 
the service AND that this cost does NOT include the cost of equipment to use 
caller ID.

I can't confirm that it may soon be free but I still believe it is true that 
the service is charged at around œ4/quarter. The 1471 service (tell me who rang 
this number last) is free.

Steve doesn't agree with me - we will come to blows :)

It's becuase the cable co's have just copied the Yankee system whereas BT have

fail to make the service available to 15% of their customers.

It sends the info before the first ring ... and IIRC (this is a bit vague now) 
it uses the exchange line ID from the exchange software but NOT using DTMF 
signals .... coded in some form or other. Nothing compatible with anyone elses

Yes this is because BT sends the INFO BEFORE the FIRST ring and NOT beteeen the 
first and second as in USA for instance.  the supra CANNOT handle this.
