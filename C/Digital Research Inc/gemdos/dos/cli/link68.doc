LINK68 creates relocatable command files in the format required by GEMDOS.


    	INPUT:	Object files, library files, overlay manager which are
    		created with CPM relocation information format, by as68,
    		ar68 or others.
    		
    		Object files:	CPM object format files with magic number
    			        601a in the header file.

    		Library files: 	library files created by ar68.

    		Overlay manager:Overlay handler(ovhdlr.o) and loader(loadr.o).

    	OUTPUT:	Root file and overlay file.
    	
    		Root file:	file name is the first file name appeared
    				in the link command.  File type is .PRG.

    		Overlay file:	Same file name as root file, but with file type
    				.O68.

SYNTAX

    	Command line options are left out here, please see GEMDOS
        Programmer's Reference Guide.  There are two ways to specify
    	link68 command:

    	LINK68 [COM[command-file.inp,   or

    	LINK68 {Output-file =} root{, ovlmgr, (ovlay-1){, (ovlay-2)...}}

    		
    	Command-file.inp:	contains same elements as in the other format
    				except that it does not include the key word
    				LINK68 at the beginning.  There can be multiple
    				lines in the .inp file.

    	Output-file:		Optional drive name and path name can be
    				specified along with the output file name.
    				The file type will be supplied as .PRG & .O68.

    	root:			object files and library files to be put in the
    				root.  Optional drive name and path name can be
    				specified for each file.
    	
    	ovlay-i:		can be defined recursively as follow:
    				a1 {, a2,....,ak,{ (ovlay-l)}}
    				where aj are object files or library files,
    				k, l are arbitrary. Optional drive name and
    				path name can be specified for each file.

EXAMPLE


    	LINK68 demo = main.o, clib, ovhdlr.o, loadr.o,(a1,a2,(b1,(c1,c2))),(d1)
    	







    		----------
    ovlay-3--->	| c1, c2 |
    		----------
    		     |
    		----------
    ovlay-2--->	|   b1	 |		-----------------	
    		----------		|		|
    		     |			|		|
    		----------		|      d1	|------>ovlay-4
    ovlay-1---> | a1, a2 |		|		|
    		----------		-----------------
    		     |__________________________|	
   				  |
    				  |
    		     ---------------------------
    		     |main, clib, ovhdlr, loadr|--------------->root
    		     ---------------------------


    The output will be demo.prg and demo.o68.  If drive name and/or path
    name were supplied in the command line, both file will be written to
    the directory specified.


LIMITATIONS


    The total number of characters in drive name:path name\file name.file type
    should not exceed 64.  The file name length can be up to 8 character,
    if file type exists, otherwise, it can be up to 12 characters.

    The maximum number of overlay you can have is 255.

    The depth of nesting overlay can be created up to 5 levels above root.

    The maximum number of characters processed in the command line is 132.
    If you have more than that, put them in a .inp file for multiple lines,
    with each line less than 132 characters.

    
DO'S AND DON'TS

    	
    	An overlay cannot reference any symbol in an overlay on the same
    	level, or in an overlay that is more than one level above, or in
    	any other branch.

    	Do not write the overlay command like (a1, (b1,b2), a2), but
    	do it like (a1, a2, (b1, b2)).

    	You need not run RELMOD after the .prg/.o68 is/are created.


 DIFFERENCE WITH PLINK'S OVERLAY MANAGER


    	Global data is overlayed if it is not specified in root.
