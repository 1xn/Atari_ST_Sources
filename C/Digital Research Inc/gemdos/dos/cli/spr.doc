SPR NO. 	COMMAND	INPUT	RESPONSE EXPLANATION

1841		DATE %%%%%%%%	% is used in the command line interpreter
    				with a special meaning: it represents a 
    				placeholder for values("parameters") that
    				you supply(or substitute) when the batch
    				file is run.  Our response for this input
    				will be "Illegal usage of %.".

1843		TIME %%%%%%%%	same as above.

1844		time @@@@@@@@	@ is used in the command line interpreter
    				with a special meaning: it takes the file
    				name following @ as input to a command that
    				preceeds the @ sign. In this case,  @@@@@@@
    				(notice only 7 @'s - not 8 @'s) is not 
    				found as a file name, hence the response is
    				"@@@@@@@ not found.".

1844		TIME <<<<<<<<   < is used in the command line interpreter
    				with a special meaning as @, so the response
    				is "<<<<<<< is not found.".

1844		TIME >>>>>>>>	> or >> is used in the command line interpre-
    				ter with a special meaning: it directs the
    				output to a file whose name is made out of the
    				characters following > or >>.  So the response
    				is "Illegal output file name: >>>>>>."

1844		TIME hh:mm:59	seconds was stored in two-second increments,
    				i.e. odd numbers will be enter as even number
    				which is 1 greater than the odd number entered.
    				In this case 60 is taken and is invalid.

1845		DATE >>>>>>>>	See explanation in the TIME >>>>>>>> command.

1845		DATE @@@@@@@@	See explanation in the TIME @@@@@@@@ command.

1845		DATE <<<<<<<<	See explanation in the TIME <<<<<<<< command.
