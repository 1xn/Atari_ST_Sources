NEW STATUS:
***********

WinColTris is FAIRWARE!

Everone, who likes this program and uses it, is asked to send me,
the author a little gift...



Changes in WinColTris 2.2 towards V2.1:

Bugfixes:
---------
* Windows could be opened in the upper left corner in the menu line
  FIXED 
  (windows might be opened in the upper left corner, but not outside 
  the desktop; in this case you have to place the windows by hand
  and leave WinColTris with saving...)

Changes:
--------
* Stonefiles are loaded from subfolders 'columns.img' for columns
  and 'tetris.img' for tetris.
  You can explicitly specify the stonefile (IMG) in the options menu. 
  The choosen file is stored in the settings independently for columns
  and tetris and for each number of colors (2,4,16 or 256).
  The files have to be in the subfolders, if other files are selected
  WinColTris offers to copy the files...
  (Using the commandline options it is possible to use files from
  other folders. Don't do that...)
  If a stonefile doesn't exist or is corrupted the old stonefile isn't
  changed.
  If a stonefile doesn't exist at the programstart WinColTris tries
  to load a default-file xxx.img\xxx1.img (where xxx stands for columns
  or tetris).
  If there is no set-file the stonefilenames are xxx.img\xxxX.img
  (xxx is columns/tetris, X is the number of planes)

* Stonefile may have less planes than the screen. Up to V2.1 Stonefiles
  had to have exactly the same number of planes. Now you can use eg.
  monochrom stones in color-resolutions or stones with 16 colors
  in 256 colors.
  Monochrom stones are displayed with colors 0 and 1 (usually black and
  white).
  However: WinColTris doesn't set any colors...

* AES-iconify instead of ICFS-iconify is supported - as far as possilbe.
  You can only iconify the play-window, the other windows will be closed
  as well.


Changes in WinColTris 2.1 towards V2.0:

Bugfixes:
---------
* WinColTris called wind_get(handle,...) with handle=-1
  MagiC 2.0 and Tos 1.4 ignored these calls, however there were
  crashs on newer Tos-versions.
  Thanx to Jens Schulz
  FIXED
* redraw problems when moving the main window during game
  FIXED
* WinColTris crashed when the main window was only partialy on the screen...
  FIXED
* the main window could be closed during game
  FIXED
* there were no checks wether windows were created correctly...
  FIXED
  If the main window can't be created the game will terminate. Otherwise
  the window will not be opened (no message about that).

Changes:
--------
* For the animation of stones, which are to be removed, WinColTris uses
  all blocks from block eight to the last not empty block, if the stones
  are from a image file. Starting with the last block, it is checked wether
  a block is empty and the first block, which is not empty, is used a the
  last block for the animation.
* The command line can be used to specify image files, which will be used
  for the stones. Filenames for tetris have to start with 't', files for
  columns with 'c'. The rest of the filenames and the extension is arbitrary, 
  the file can be specified with a path.
* There is a alert, when you quit WinColTris...
  If you don't want that alert, you can switch it off...
* If you installed the iconify server (writte by Dirk Haun), you can iconify
  the windows if you close one of them with shift-, control- or alternate.
  All window are always iconified to on icon!
  If the iconification or the reopening of the windows fails, WinColTris
  terminates...
* You can cycle stones counterclockwise by ')' (on the num-pad). Another
  key for this can be defined.
* there is some sound and more sound prepared, but no english explanation to
  this...
  you can switch the sound on and off in the options.
* if a window (e.g. for the preview) was closed during a non multitasking
  game, window redraw by other programms wasn't possible. This has changed.
  After closing the window WinColTris enables redraws for some time (100ms).
  In this time parallel applications can make screen output and the mouse
  is shown. Please note: WinColTris can't control what the other programs
  do. They can open a dialog, an alert, windows or even start a program...
  After this time WinColTris checkes if its main window is the top window
  (otherwise it is topped; this is not checked for the other windows of
  WinColTris). Then the game continues...
* If the game is paused, parallel running programs, moving windows etc.
  is possible.
  You can't use menu shortcuts however. Every keypress quits the pause.
  If the pause is quited, the main window or all windows (as on starting the
  game) are topped and the game continues...
* there are two monchrom sprite-files (*.IMX), which can be use if the
  screen height is at least 480 pixel. These stones are bigger than the
  builtin stones. Either you start the program with these files as parameters
  or you rename them to *.IMG.
* there is no 'save' menu item any more. Changed options and hiscore is
  saved automaticly if you leave the program with 'Quit'. Leaving with
  'Abort' doesn't save anything.
