This is a system that enables you to include lines like ;

   speak(1,"Hi There");

In your Lattice C programs. The program which actually carries out the speaking 
is called SPEAKER.PRG. This is part of a public domain document reader system
by Delroy Marks, which installs itself as a TSR program, and intercepts the 
TRAP #8 machine instruction.

The sample C program included shows how to set the program up, and the interface
library is included both as assembler source and GST format binary file.

If the language you are using supports in-line assembler, you can use the 
assembler source directly. Otherwise, you can try linking the GST file if your
language supports it.

If you need any help, don't hesitate to contact me on this BB.
