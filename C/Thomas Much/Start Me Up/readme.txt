SMU8 Source Code
================
Copyright (c)1996-98 by Thomas Much

The development of SMU ("Start me up") is finished, at least it offers all
features that *I* need. Of course there are things that would be nice to have,
but I simply do not have enough time to implement them. So, if you are missing
a feature, you can do it yourself now :-)

If you create a new SMU version, please do not distribute it under my name.
Still, all SMU distributions must have the copyright notice "SMU copyright
1996-98 by Thomas Much".
If you only have a few lines of C source code to add to my version (e.g. a
bug fix), please feel free to contact me, so maybe we can release a new
"official" version together. Your additions must be free of copyright, or
the owner of the copyright must have granted the release of the source code
and the free distribution of the compiled version.

The source code is provided "as is" without any warranty.

START.PRJ is the PureC 1.1 project file.
