     I include  here  a  word  game   program,  Dic_game.   This  has  been
     undertaken more as an exercise in  my attempt to learn 'C' programming
     rather than with any thought that it  could  be of any value to anyone
     else.

     I  would be  most grateful for feedback  from  anyone  who  might find
     time  to cast  their  eye over  the  source  code.   I've no doubt the
     program is far  from being as  efficiently   written  as  it  might be
     and any help forthcoming towards this end would be much appreciated.

     You will see that in the   source   code the 'dictionary' is not shown
     directly but is encrypted; it  seemed   to  me  to add interest for it
     not to be immediately readable even here.
