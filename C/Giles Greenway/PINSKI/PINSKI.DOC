                                 By G Greenway

                               An Introduction:

          PINSKI  is  a  silly little proglette I wrote to draw Sierpinski
     Gaskets. <What's one of those when it's at home ?>

          Well, start with an equilateral triangle:


                                      /\
                                     /  \
                                    /    \
                                    ÿÿÿÿÿÿ

          Now, divide it up into four other triangles:


                                      /\
                                     /  \
                                    /____\
                                   /\    /\
                                  /  \  /  \
                                 /    \/    \
                                 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

          Disgard  the  centre triangle, then divide the remaining ones up
     in a simmilar way:


                                      /\
                                     /  \
                                    /____\
                                   /\    /\
                                  /  \  /  \
                                 /____\/____\
                                /\          /\
                               /  \        /  \
                              /____\      /____\
                             /\    /\    /\    /\
                            /  \  /  \  /  \  /  \
                           /    \/    \/    \/    \
                           ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ

          Keep going ad infinitum, and you will end up with something that
     looks  more and more like a Sierpinski Gasket. The process is said to
     be "recursive".

          Strange  coincidence number one: the Sierpinski Gasket is linked
     with Pascal's Triange. <Okay, whats *that* when it's at home ?>
     
          Build  a  triangular  array  of numbers, start with a '1' at the
     triangle's  apex,  then  fill in the rest of the entries so that each
     number is the sum of the numbers directly above it:


                                      01

                                    01  01

                                  01  02  01

                                01  03  03  01

                              01  04  06  04  01

                            01  05  10  10  05  01

                          01  06  15  20  15  06  01

                        01  07  21  35  35  21  07  01

          This  is  where  it  gets *almost* interesting, pick out the odd
     numbers,  or,  to  put  it  another  way,  the numbers that are not a
     multiple of two:


                                      **

                                    **  **

                                  **      **

                                **  **  **  **

                              **              **

                            **  **          **  **

                          **      **      **      **

                        **  **  **  **  **  **  **  **

          Look  familiar  ? Of course, one can also plot the entries using
     other   multiples  (or  moduli)  to  obtain  different patterns. This
     method  of  drawing  the  gasket  is  sometimes  called  a  "cellular
     automaton".

          There  is  another  way to draw the gasket. Start with, (can you
     guess)  an  equilateral  triangle. Pick two of the corners at random,
     and  plot the mid-point of the line that joins them. Now, pick one of
     the  three  original corners, and find the mid-point of the line that
     joins  it  to  the  new  point.  Keep  choosing corners at random and
     plotting  the  mid-points  and  you  will  slowly  start  to build up
     something  that looks eerily familiar... Any technique that relies on
     random numbers is often refered to as a "Monte-Carlo method".

                                 The Program:

          Once  you  run  the program by double-clicking its icon a window
     and  menu-bar  will  appear. To start with, the window will contain a
     picture  of  the  gasket  drawn  using the cellular automaton method,
     modulo 2. This means means that all even entries in Pascal's triangle
     will be plotted in black. You can move and size the window as normal.
     The  Desk  menu  contains  an  "About  PINSKI"  option along with any
     accessories you may have resident.

          Select the "Set Options" item from the File menu. A dialogue box
     will  appear.  At  the  top  there are buttons to select the cellular
     automaton,  Monte-Carlo  or  recursive  method. Below this is another
     pair  of  buttons  used  to  select  inverse  video  for the cellular
     automaton. (Black pixels are plotted white and vice versa. This looks
     better  for  certain  moduli...)  Next  there  are  two editable text
     fields.  The  first  allows  you  to  change  the  modulo used by the
     cellular  automaton  method.  Try  values  of  6  and  9.  Notice the
     similarity  between  patterns  created  using prime numbers. (Numbers
     divisable only by themselves and 1.) The second field lets you choose
     the  depth used by the recursive method. A setting of 0 just produces
     a  single  triangle.  Click  on  the Okay button at the bottom or hit
     return  when you have finished changing the options. Note that if the
     Monte-Carlo  method  has been selected then the program will continue
     to plot new points until you click the mouse button.

          The  Save  Image option calls up a file-selector that allows you
     to  save  the current image in compressed .IMG format. Load them into
     something  nice  like ImageCopy, Munch or Kandinsky. Finally, you can
     leave the program by either selecting the Quit option or by using the
     close box in the top left-hand corner of the window.

                             Some Closing Remarks:

     <Why's it called a fractal ?>
          A  fractal  is  an  object  that  has  a fractional or "fractal"
     dimension.  In  other words, it is of a dimension that is not a whole
     number.

     <Strange...>
          Yep.  There's no fixed definition of fractal dimension, they all
     vary  slightly, and only agree some of the time. If it helps, most of
     them  say that the Sierpinski Gasket has a fractal dimension of about
     1.5850.

     <Who is this Sierpinski guy anyway ?>
          Waclaw Sierpinski, 1882-1969. A Polish mathematician. One of the
     Moon's craters is named after him.

     <Where can I find out more ?>
          Try reading the following:

     James Gleick, Chaos, Making A New Science.
          Perhaps  the  best  book  for  the  layman.  Discusses chaos and
     fractals in some detail without using any mathematics. Excellent.

     Michael Barnsley, Fractals Everywhere.
          Based on a university lecture course. Reads like one too.

     Clifford A. Pickover, Computers, Pattern Chaos And Beauty.
          Describes  the  use  of  computers  to  generate  all  sorts  of
     patterns.  Rather  off-beat,  but  fun. The sequel, Computers And The
     Imagination,  is  even  stranger,  and  even  more fun. You have been
     warned.

     Benoit Mandelbrot, The Fractal Geometry Of Nature.
          The  one  that  started  them  all  !  (Well, some of them...) A
     classic,  but not very readable. (He even invents his own "digression
     marks" !)

     Peitgen,  Juergens  and  Saupe,  Chaos And Fractals, New Frontiers Of
     Science.
          My favourite. Allows you to go into all the theory if your maths
     is up to it, but is still very readable for "normal" people. Provides
     a very good starting point for writing your own programs.


                              Enjoy Theeselves !
