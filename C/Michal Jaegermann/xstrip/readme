This archive contains sources for x(tended)strip utility, which allows
you to be a little be more selective with what you remove from your
executables than usual chain-saw strip.  The source will compile both
with gcc (distribution libraries) and with Sozobon C (dLibs).
This will be useful only if you know what you are doing, and if you
know then undoubtely you have a compiler.  Therefore only sources are
posted.  Hack at your will, if you feel so inclined.

    Enjoy,
    Michal
