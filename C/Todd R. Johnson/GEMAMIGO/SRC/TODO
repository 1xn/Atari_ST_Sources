There are lots of things which need adding/improving.

	o	smaller board sizes (only supports 19x19 right now)

	o	take back last move

	o	log the game/save position

	o	tidy up the code & include files

	o	stopwatch cursor when it is AmiGo's turn?

If you have any additions to this list, please mail them to me!
