Build Notes

Atari Setboot Utility, Version 1.1 for TOS
Atari Computer Corporation
Principal Developer: Hans-Martin Kroeber
Date: 02/17/1992


1. Product Description

	This is a utility for setting the boot preference in the NVRAM. It
can be set to either TOS, Atari System V or no boot preference. It is a
component of the Atari System V Administration tools package. It must be
packaged on a TOS formatted disk.

2. Items Submitted to SCM

	A copy of the build notes is submitted to SCM. The product source and
the product itself are available on floppy disk in TOS format held by SCM.

3. Summary of Changes from Previous Release

	The label of the "Cancel" button in the Reboot dialog box was renamed to
"Continue". Also, the text now fits into the dialog box when the program
reports the message that the NVRAM has to be initialized.
	
4. Build Configuration Requirements

4.1 Hardware Requirements

	The TT should have at least 2 Megabytes of RAM and a device capable of
reading TOS formatted media (floppy disk drive). To compile the utility, a
TOS partition on the hard disk is also required. The compiling can be done
on an ST with hard disk, too, but the program will only run on a TT.

4.2 Software Requirements

	Building the utility requires the TOS operating system and the
Mark Williams C Developing System for the Atari ST, Version 3.xx. Please notice
that not all programs of the Mark Williams C 3.xx system run smoothly on a TT.
You might want to use a different shell, like gulam. Also, the micro Emacs
which comes with MWC might not run in all resolutions. It shouldn't be
a problem to compile the utility with other TOS C compilers. The makefile and
the names of the header files have to be changed.

5. Compatibility with Previous Release

	Not applicable.
	
6. Limitations and Warnings

	When the value in the NVRAM is set by this utility to an operating
system which is not installed on the system, the system will hang. This happens 
because it never stops searching for a boot sector of that OS. If that
happens, insert the floppy disk with the Setboot utility into the internal
floppy disk drive and hit a key. The system than will start TOS and you are
able to execute Seboot again to set the NVRAM boot preference to an existing
OS. Setting it to 'No preference' will always work.

7. Conformity and Specifications

	Not applicable.
	
8. Build Instructions

	The source of the utility is available on floppy disk held by SCM in 
TOS format. To make the utility the following steps are necessary:
	
	1. Insert floppy disk with source of Setboot into the floppy disk 
	   drive. (TOS has to be booted.)
	   
	2. Use GEM to open the window with the directory of the floppy disk.
	
	3. Open the window of the harddisk partition where the Mark Williams C
	   Developing System 3.xx is installed.
	   
	4. Use GEM to copy the folder "SETBOOT" from floppy into the "SRC"
	   folder of partion containting the Mark Williams C. There is also
	   a folder "INCLUDE" on the floppy. This shouldn't have to be used.
	   It contains the header files used by the utility which should
	   already have been installed through the Mark Williams System.
	   
	5. Execute the Mark Williams Shell "MSH.PRG" using GEM.
	
	6. Enter "cd \src\setboot".
	
	7. To compile the utility, enter "make".
	
	8. To execute it, type "gem setboot" or type "exit" to exit the MSH
	   and execute it from the GEM desktop. Note that the program requires
	   a TT, because only on a TT Atari System V is available. Iif you
	   execute it on an ST, an alert pops up, saying that the program
	   runs only on a TT. Nevertheless, if you just want to see how the
	   program looks like, you are able to run it on an ST for testing
	   purpose. This requires that you insert the line "CFLAGS=-DDEBUG=1" 
	   at the beginning of the "makefile". BE SURE TO TAKE OUT THIS LINE
	   AGAIN when you compile the utility for FINAL RELEASE.
	   
	Enter "make clean" to remove all files produced by building the source.
	
To make a master floppy disk of the Setboot utility enter "make install" while
you are running the MSH and your current directory is "\SRC\SETBOOT". This
requires that a TOS formatted floppy disk was inserted into the internal
floppy disk drive (Drive A:). "Make install" will copy the files "SETBOOT.PRG"
and "SETBOOT.RSC" onto the floppy disk. "SETBOOT.PRG" is the executable
program and "SETBOOT.RSC" is the GEM resource file containing the dialog boxes
and strings. To make copies of this master disk, use the GEM desktop.

8.1 Internationalization

	TOS does not offer global language support like Atari System V does. 
Nevertheless, there is no recompiling necessary when you want to translate
the strings used in the dialog boxes and menu bar. All strings are loaded
with the resource file "SETBOOT.RSC". So use the GEM Resource Construction
Set to change these strings. Each subsidary should be able to do this.

9. Out Standing Problems
	
	None.
