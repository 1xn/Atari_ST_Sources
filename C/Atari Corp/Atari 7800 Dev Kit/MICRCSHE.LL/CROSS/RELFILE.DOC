Relocatable file format for 6502 xassembler

bytes		meaning
8	magic number & version id

Symbol Table
2	number of entries
	Each entry:
		1	flags	0 - section name
				1 - relocatable
				2 - local
				7 - end of table
		string	symbol name
		2	value
		2	section
Values of section symbols are set at time of link and may not be used
for any calculations.

The last table entry is only 1 byte long.

Text:
Repeat until section == 0xffff:
	2	section
	repeat until offset == 0xffff:
		2	offset to first valid data
		2	length of data
		n	data
	end repeat
end repeat

Relocation Info:
Repeat until section == 0xffff:
	2	section
	repeat until offset == 0xffff:
		2	offset to first relocation data
		1	result	0 - 0 = byte, 1 = word
		repeat until operation = 0:
			1	operation	
				   	0 - 5 - operation
					  0 = null operation
					  1 = add
					  2 = subtract
					  3 = multiply
					  4 = divide
					  5 = mod
					  6 = not
					  7 = XOR
					  8 = or
					  9 = and
					 10 = one's complement
					 11 = shift left
					 12 = shift right
					 13 = high byte

			2	value or symbol reference
